                A Bloomberg headline recently declared,
                <a
                  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-17/microsoft-layoffs-highlight-ai-driven-hiring-pauses"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >"The AI Hiring Pause Is Officially Here"</a
                >. Here are some data points:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Microsoft just laid off 6,000 employees in product management
                  and software engineering.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Norway's sovereign wealth fund paused hiring, citing AI.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shopify's hiring philosophy is to try to use AI to do a job
                  before expanding headcount.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The Bloomberg headline is overstated, because there are still
                plenty of software jobs out there. But this is indeed the
                beginning of a massive dislocation of knowledge workers
                generally, and its consequences will be vast.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you're reading this you may already agree with this
                prediction. But here is a basic walkthrough of why this
                dislocation will happen in the coming years:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Knowledge workers, especially ones in the United States, are
                  expensive. They can cost six-figures or more per year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Knowledge workers get paid to produce information. Lawyers
                  produce briefs. Coders produce code. Marketers produce ads.
                  Etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Language models allow computers to produce high-quality
                  information, on any topic, on demand, instantly, for very
                  cheap.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Language models already do this well today, but they will get
                  even better every few months unless we hit some sort of wall.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Companies typically care about maximizing revenue and minimizing
                expenses. Given this, they will be faced with the following
                choice:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Hire a credentialed American knowledge worker for $100k+ per
                  year plus benefits, including a hiring process that takes
                  existing employees' time, a new hire onboarding period of a
                  couple months, and an unknown tenure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Get a language model to do the thing right now really well for
                  like $1.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Increasingly, companies will realize this is the choice before
                them. They will stop hiring knowledge workers â€“ especially
                American ones. The AI hiring pause is not here, because hiring
                is still happening, but it is coming.
