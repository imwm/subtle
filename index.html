                The title is slightly provocative, but I wanted to collect a few
                observations about the psychology of discovering and adopting
                new products in this new age of software development. If I think
                about the tools I've personally adopted as daily workhorses –
                ChatGPT, Cursor, Devin – I was not convinced to try them by a
                landing page...

                As new tools allow individuals to contribute in domains outside

                roles merge into something akin to "Software Creator." This
                parallels the creator economy, where new publishing tools
                allowed independent media creators to compete with incumbent
                media companies...

                Tools like Cursor and Lovable are making it way easier to build

                previous prices and timelines in this new world. Previously,
                agencies could quote low/mid six figures for 3-6 months of work,
                but now a solo developer can build the same product in weeks...

                Lovable is reportedly the fastest growing startup in the world.
                After trying it out, I noticed their extremely aggressive
                paywall - just 5 prompts per day on the free tier. This creates
                a perverse incentive: if Lovable became excellent at
                one-shotting users' app concepts, fewer people would hit the
                usage limits, reducing the growth of their paid tier...

                o3, including its verbose nature, technical depth, and how it

                OpenAI is reportedly in talks to buy Windsurf for $3 billion,

                observations about Cursor (and Windsurf's) potential to expand

              <p>
                "The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup
                ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have

                A common pain point working with code generation tools like
                Cursor is that with every new chat, the agent needs to scan the
                code base to get context. The agent acts as though it's never
                seen this codebase before, even if it wrote every line of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best way to mitigate this is to include a product
                requirements doc (PRD) as a markdown file in the repo...

              <p>
                Today Stripe added the ability to copy the text of their docs or
                view the page as markdown. This is an example of a company
                proactively making the contents of their webpages more readily
                available for LLMs.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, this is one of over 50 billion webpages. There's a
                tragedy of the commons problem: most webpages won't make
                /llms.txt or equivalent available anytime soon. In the meantime,
                that's what stringme.dev is for...

              <p>
                The main lesson from building stringme.dev was to identify the
                languages, frameworks, and services you'll need up front when
                vibe coding.
              </p>
              <p>
                We ran into problems when we told Cursor mid-project that we
                wanted to use Tailwind, deploy via Vercel, or switch from
                TypeScript to JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's how we vibe-coded stringme.dev and what we learned along

                Also improved text optimization for LLMs while stubbornly

                The main point I wanted to discuss is their defense of LLM

                For too long the crypto economy was an isolated atoll, with

              <p>
                Clearly the Collisons write without LLMs. They raw dog the page

                A subtle approach to newsletter sponsorships
              </h3>
              <p>
                A little newsletter called flowstate.fm asked us for help with
                their sponsorship business.
              </p>
              <p>
                They wanted to make a website where people could book weekly
                sponsorships directly. They also wanted some help with outbound
                lead generation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result is sponsor.flowstate.fm which we built in just a few
                hours. Here's how we did it...

                Commoditized intelligence will lead to ephemeral coworkers
              </h3>
              <p>
                Azeem Azhar recently summarized the before/after of commoditized
                intelligence (Bloomberg):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                For most of history, hiring a dozen PhDs meant a massive budget
                and months of lead time. Today, a few keystrokes in a chatbot
                summon that brainpower in seconds.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In light of this sudden appearance of free intelligence, Azhar
                continues, there's an important question:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                The question facing individuals and organizations alike is: What
                will you do when intelligence itself is suddenly ubiquitous and
                practically free?
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The way I think about this is that the traditional company is
                being unbundled...

              <p>
                When you're working for a company, your compensation is
                typically a salary and maybe a bonus and/or stock options, with
                performance reviews determining your success. But in one person
                teams, the only priority is customer service – compensation is
                exactly company revenue, determined entirely by customers rather
                than managers...
