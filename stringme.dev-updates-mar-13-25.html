              </p>
              <p>
                I added quick URL buttons so you can instantly try the service
                with example websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                The copy across the site got a significant upgrade too. Clearer,
                more concise, and hopefully a bit more engaging.
              </p>
              <p>
                I implemented Mozilla's <strong>readabilityjs</strong> to strip
                away all that extraneous filler text from webpages. You know,
                the stuff that makes your eyes glaze over when you're just
                trying to get to the content.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've also improved the text optimization while stubbornly
                refusing to use an LLM for this process itself. It's become
                something of a personal challenge, though I will probably cave
                at some point. (Google's new
                <a
                  href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-3/"

                model seems promising.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Navigation improved, with keyboard shortcuts and better handling
                of back navigation from the generated plain text.
                Quality-of-life improvements like this add up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Behind the scenes, I consolidated the local and API text
                formatting/optimization functions, which should make future
                improvements more manageable. Plus, I made some subtle layout
                tweaks that you probably won't notice but would definitely miss
                if they weren't there.

                Tomorrow I'll post a more comprehensive breakdown of how this
                project came together from the beginning, along with some
                lessons learned along the way.

                Full disclosure, this post was like 7 dashed-off bullet points
                that were rewritten by Claude 3.7 Sonnet within Cursor.
