                Software is becoming much easier to create, and there will be
                many second-order effects. Here's one, which was highlighted in
                a recent episode of My First Million featuring Matt Mazeo (<a

                of reaching out and saying, "Hey would you like me to maybe do
                this for you if you pay me and hire me?" Instead you say, "Check
                this out, I made this for you, want to work with me?" Obviously
                that's going to be a better sales pitch, and AI made that
                scalable. That was not scalable before....<br /><br />

              <p>
                I've started to think about software as pre-LLM and post-LLM.
                You can also think about sales/marketing in a similar paradigm.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since LLMs dramatically lower the barrier to creating software,
                post-LLM marketing should deliver product value without the end
                recipient having to do anything.
              </p>

                I'm working on a data product that's geared toward media/PR/ad
                executives. I built the MVP with live data and sent it to a few
                people for initial validation. Not only did this give me early
                signal on whether the product is actually valuable, but it also
                allowed for more accurate price discovery and even drove a
                couple transactions.
              </p>

              <p>
                This product is in closed beta right now but if you're curious
                about it,
