                Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel, recently gave a
                <a

                at Stanford Business School. Aside from noting that the series
                should really be called "view from the climb," he made the
                essential point that entrepreneurs are de facto always selling,
                and need to get comfortable and good at doing that.
              </p>

              <p>
                For background, Ken founded Citadel in 1990 and it has become
                the most successful hedge fund of all time. He was early to
                applying computer science and math to trading, and Citadel is a
                market-maker responsible for roughly 1 in 4 trades in U.S.
                financial markets.
              </p>

              <p>The relevant portion starts at around the 10-minute mark:</p>

              <blockquote>
                Let me tell you how much I enjoyed selling when I was 20: that
                would be a donut.<br /><br />

                My physics teacher who was my partner in Chicago, when he
                retired he said, "You can have whatever you want from my
                office." I said I wanted the $10 plaque that was behind his desk
                which said, "If we're all gonna eat, someone has to sell."<br /><br />

                When I was 20 years old and I looked at that plaque, it was like
                a wakeup moment. It speaks to the importance of what it takes to
                build a business. You're always selling. You're selling to
                candidates, you're selling to vendors, you're selling to
                counterparties, you're selling to customers.<br /><br />

                And you just have to get comfortable with the fact that if
                you're always selling, you know what you're going to hear a lot?
                "No." "Not gonna do that." "Not interested."...<br /><br />

                You're gonna hear "no" a lot, but you need to get accustomed to
                having to market your ideas, market what you represent, and
                market what you stand for. Whether it's the people who you want
                to have work for you, or people who are trying to give you
                capital, or customers. You need to get comfortable with the art
                of selling.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                I've previously taken a degree of pride in not being comfortable
                selling. I gravitated toward the product and engineering parts
                of the business in part because it was all about making the best
                thing, regardless of how people slang it.
              </p>

              <p>
                But those product and engineering departments kept their
                salaries only because there was a sales department doing the
                hard work of locating likely buyers and convincing them to open
                their wallets for our solution.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's a very useful saying: "If we're all gonna eat, someone has
                to sell."
              </p>

              <p>
                This is a harsh reality for one-person companies, for which the
                saying can be simplified: "If I'm gonna eat, I have to sell."
                This is probably the #1 functional skill I'll have to develop in
                this new venture.

                Based on what it knows about me, ChatGPT suggested
                <em>The Challenger Sale</em> and <em>To Sell Is Human</em> as
                books on sales to start with. If you have any other suggestions,
