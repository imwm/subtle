                Here's a new thing:
                <a
                  href="https://distilljs.com"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  ><b>DistillJS</b></a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                DistillJS allows you to recreate a specific LLM behavior in
                Javascript.
              </p>
              <p>
                I built this because in various projects, I kept having to call
                LLMs via API for simple tasks, such as summarizing or
                classifying text. It would be much better if that functionality
                were part of the application itself: lower latency, no usage
                charges, and no API keys to manage.
              </p>
              <p>
                I heard o3 was really smart, so I figured I'd assign it the
                challenge of writing a minified JS file that delivers 80-90% of
                the functionality of an LLM on a specific task. DistillJS is the
                result.
              </p>
              <p>It works in three steps:</p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <b>Define the task</b>: Write a prompt that describes the task
                  you want the LLM to perform (e.g. "summarize this text in 2-3
                  sentences").
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Provide examples</b>: Give a few good examples of
                  input/output pairs (DistillJS can generate the outputs for you
                  using gpt-4o-mini).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Distill</b>: Ask o3 (or o4-mini) to write a minified JS
                  function that reproduces similar outputs for a wide variety of
                  inputs, mutatis mutandis.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I've mainly been testing this on summarization tasks, and the
                files o3 comes up with work surprisingly well (but aren't
                perfect). You can try the summarization demo yourself on
                <a
                  href="https://distilljs.com"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >distilljs.com</a
                >
                by clicking "autofill" on the prompt and "auto-generate" on the
                examples.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a possibility DistillJS is a fool's errand, because it's
                essentially asking a deterministic Javascript file to play in
                the same league as a machine learning model.
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  The reason machine learning has become ubiquitous is that it's
                  proven dramatically more effective than deterministic
                  programming at producing better results across a wide range of
                  tasks and inputs.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>But I think this project is worth a shot for a few reasons:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  It's a pain to call LLM APIs for simple tasks – it's
                  computationally and financially more expensive. People want a
                  better solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  o3 is really smart. o4 will be even smarter. They're full of
                  surprises.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Even if o3 or o4 can't achieve >90% performance in Javascript,
                  even 80% or 70% performance would be worth the trade-off in
                  certain cases.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I heard a quote recently – was it from Sam Altman? – that if you
                find yourself building a product that's right on the cusp of
                current model capabilities, that's a good place to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                DistillJS feels like it's on that cusp.
