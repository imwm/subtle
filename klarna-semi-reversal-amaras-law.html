                In early 2024, Klarna became the poster child of using AI to
                eliminate jobs. They

                that their OpenAI-powered support bot was handling two-thirds of
                their support requests, doing the work of roughly 700 human
                agents. They also said they were going to pause hiring and net
                reduce headcount, as they prepared for an IPO.

                Now, they have changed their tune – it's not a complete
                reversal, as some headlines suggested, but in fact a more
                nuanced approach than AI > human:

                Klarna Group Plc's chief executive says his pursuit of
                cost-cutting in customer service, fueled by advancements in
                artificial intelligence, has gone too far....
                <br /><br />Co-founder Siemiatkowski said the firm is piloting a
                new cohort of employees "in an Uber type of setup" where they
                can log in and work remotely, with a view to eventually
                replacing "the few thousand human agents" that Klarna currently
                outsources.... <br /><br />The pilot has started small, with two
                of the new breed of customer-service agents live now, but the
                ambition is to tap into candidates such as students or rural
                populations. "We also know there are tons of Klarna users that
                are very passionate about our company and would enjoy working
                for us," he added.<br /><br />
                "From a brand perspective, a company perspective," Siemiatkowski
                said, "I just think it's so critical that you are clear to your
                customer that there will be always a human if you want."...
                <br /><br />"As cost unfortunately seems to have been a too
                predominant evaluation factor when organizing [our support
                function], what you end up having is lower quality," he said.
                "Really investing in the quality of the human support is the way
                of the future for us."

                of 2,000 CEOs found that "only 25% of AI initiatives have

                Now, there may be some factors particular to Klarna. Over on

                <a
                  href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43955917"

                  >floated the theory</a
                >
                that last year's announcement was meant to frame Klarna "as an
                'AI-first tech company' when it goes public, and not a 'buy now
                pay later loan company' because AI companies have higher
                valuations even with the same revenue." They might've pushed
                that strategy past its limit over the last year and discovered
                terrible results in customer experience surveys.

                In any case, the megatrend remains true, that LLMs allow
                computers to do work that humans previously did, which will only
                accelerate as models and products improve. The demand for
                knowledge workers will go down as a cheaper, better, faster
                substitute good – knowledge agents – emerges. This is a
                capitalistic imperative: companies will be forced – either by
                their boards, shareholders, or competitors – to adjust their
                workforce towards digital agents. Just being real with you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The takeaway from Klarna's situation and the study above isn't
                that LLMs have no role to play in organizational efficiency. The
                takeaway is that effective enterprise adoption of LLMs should be
                done carefully and responsibly, and despite the hype, it will
                take years for this transformation to yield significant results.

                says, "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the
                short run and underestimate the effect in the long run." The
                data points above are examples of overestimating the effect of a
                technology in the short run. Let's not commit the second half of
                the fallacy by over-extrapolating them.
