              <p>
                I'm building a subscription data product (if you're curious,
                <a href="mailto:hi@subtle.so" class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >reach out</a
                >). I've been thinking about the strengths and weaknesses of
                this genre of software. Examples of subscription data products
                are Nielsen, App Annie, and Comscore. Bloomberg, too, in a way.
              </p>

              <p>
                Here are the strengths and weaknesses of subscription data
                products, in my estimation. Some of these reference concepts in
                the
                <a

                  >7 Powers</a
                >
                framework, which is the best articulation of business moats I've
                come across.
              </p>

              <p>Strengths:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <b>Cornered Resource:</b> If the data you have is truly
                  exclusive, it's a cornered resource. That means people can't
                  compete with you because they don't have the data you have.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Enterprise Value:</b> Companies need competitive and market
                  intel to make good decisions. If your data product helps an
                  executive make one better decision a year, that's six- or
                  more-figures of value already.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Scalability:</b> The economic miracle of software
                  businesses is that you can build it once and sell it
                  endlessly. With data products, this is especially true.
                  Whereas SaaS companies need to navigate user feature requests
                  and UX, data products basically just provide information. It's
                  much more of a what-you-see-is-what-you-get value prop than
                  SaaS.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Value Accrual:</b> Every day that passes, your data product
                  accumulates more valuable information, adding to the value
                  pile. This means that the longer the product exists, the more
                  valuable it is.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>Weaknesses:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  As mentioned above, building scraping agents is much easier
                  than it was before LLMs (see tools like Cursor and Firecrawl).
                  Anyone can do it if they put their mind to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The TAM for these products isn't huge. The world of executives
                  who need specific data to make crucial decisions is not as
                  large, say, as the market of employees who want to communicate
                  via instant message (Slack).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                There are two ways I'm thinking of overcoming these weaknesses:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <b>Time-series data:</b> This is impossible to replicate,
                  because people can't travel back in time to get past
                  statistics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Services:</b> A friend heard from a CRO of a major gaming
                  company that they're no longer signing larger software
                  contracts; they're only signing a blend of software/services
                  contracts, because they want to partner with people to build
                  stuff. Software is being commoditized. I'm planning to
                  basically partner with my early users and co-build the product
                  together, giving them free rein to text me about whatever
                  features and additional data they want. This takes away from
                  the scalability advantage mentioned above, but I think it's
                  worth doing in the early days (and later, for a premium tier).
