                A little newsletter called
                <a
                  href="https://flowstate.fm"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"

                  ><strong>Flow State</strong></a
                >
                asked us for help with their sponsorship business.
              </p>
              <p>
                They wanted to make a website where people could book weekly
                sponsorships directly. They also wanted some help with outbound
                lead generation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result is
                <a
                  href="https://sponsor.flowstate.fm"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"

                >
                which we built in just a few hours. Here's how we did it.
              </p>
              <p>tl;dr: <strong>Cursor</strong> is amazing.</p>
              <ul class="list-disc mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li class="ml-4">
                  We used <strong>Cursor's</strong> agent to build a
                  <strong>nextjs</strong> app. We selected the new
                  <strong>Claude 3.7</strong> model, which is excellent at
                  understanding an entire codebase – identifying existing
                  patterns and applying them. It also seems to have better
                  design sense than <strong>Claude 3.5</strong>.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  By default, you have to manually accept every change that
                  <strong>Cursor's</strong> agent proposed, but they recently
                  introduced "yolo" mode which auto-accepts code changes.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  The only time the agent got stuck was on weird errors. One
                  happened when I was on <strong>Tailwind 4</strong> and it
                  couldn't understand that <strong>PostCSS</strong> was a
                  different package. Another occurred when
                  <strong>Vercel</strong> inexplicably failed to install its own
                  analytics package during build.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  Eventually I reached the point where I wasn't using the code
                  editor at all, just the agent and the terminal (mostly for git
                  commands).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Other services we used:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li class="ml-4"><strong>Stripe</strong>: No brainer.</li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  <strong>Supabase</strong>: Shout out to Rick for recommending
                  this. It's very nice and easy to use. "What
                  <strong>Firebase</strong> should have been," as they say.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  <strong>Vercel</strong>: <strong>Cursor</strong> wanted to do
                  a <strong>NextJS</strong> app and then deploy it on
                  <strong>Vercel</strong>. I hadn't used
                  <strong>Vercel</strong> before, but it was super easy: login
                  with <strong>GitHub</strong>, pick the repo, hit deploy, fix a
                  few build errors that <strong>Cursor</strong> identified, and
                  then deploy. It auto-redeploys whenever
                  <code class="text-sm bg-black/75 px-1 rounded-md">main</code>
                  is updated.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                With
                <a
                  href="https://sponsor.flowstate.fm"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"

                >
                set up and taking bookings, we needed to generate leads. Here's
                how we did that:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li class="ml-4">
                  We asked <strong>ChatGPT</strong> where to find leads. It
                  offered several suggestions, including using
                  <a
                    href="https://hunter.io"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    target="_blank"
                    ><strong>hunter.io</strong></a
                  >
                  for finding emails.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  We signed up for
                  <a
                    href="https://hunter.io"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    target="_blank"
                    ><strong>hunter.io</strong></a
                  >, which let us (a) pick an industry, (b) pick companies, (c)
                  pick departments (marketing), and (d) find emails. From about
                  50 companies, we gathered 500 email addresses.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  We downloaded the CSV of 500 contacts with metadata (company,
                  name, location), added columns for subject line and email
                  body, and wrote those for the first contact.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  We uploaded the CSV to <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and asked
                  <strong>GPT-4.5</strong> to fill in the remaining subject
                  lines and email bodies based on the first one. It completed
                  this in about 5 seconds.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-4">
                  From the 500 contacts and emails, we selected 50 to start with
                  – maximum one per company, prioritizing the most senior
                  marketing person. We've sent those out and hopefully we get at
                  least one booking!
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Finally, we reckon other people might be interested in this kind
                of calendar booking site. We used
                <a
                  href="https://getwaitlist.com"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  ><strong>getwaitlist.com</strong></a
                >
                to set up a simple waitlist for a product called
                <strong
                  ><a
                    href="https://getwaitlist.com/waitlist/25963"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
