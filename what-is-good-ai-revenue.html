                There have been recent reports of highly capitalized AI startups
                earning questionable revenue:

                  There are even some questions about Perplexity coming from its

                That said, we also saw two incredible fundraises today proving
                that AI startups are setting records for revenue growth:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  OpenAI raised $40B at a $300B valuation, expecting revenue to
                  rise to $29.4B next year (<a
                    href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/31/openai-300-billion-softbank"

                    >Axios</a
                  >).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cursor raised $625M at a $9.6B valuation, having just hit
                  $200M in ARR, mere months after setting the record for fastest
                  startup to achieve $100M ARR (<a
                    href="https://x.com/ArfurRock/status/1906768733135098360"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    >Twitter</a
                  >).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Recently, we asked
                <a
                  href="/is-cursor-a-good-business"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >whether Cursor is a good business</a
                >. The answer is probably yes. While there are some reasons to
                be bearish – the switching costs among AI products are low – it
                looks like there is a huge brand moat for the companies that
                become the clear leader in their category. ChatGPT is a
                household name; Cursor is the ChatGPT for software engineering.
              </p>

              <p>
                The nuance is that you need to be out of strike range of
                ChatGPT. Back in 2022, Jasper was all the rage because it was
                emerging as the first category leader for "AI for marketing."
                But its business apparently dried up after ChatGPT launched,
                effectively supplanting Jasper's basic text-generation
                capabilities.
              </p>

              <p>
                I suspect something similar is happening with Perplexity.
                Perplexity was the first category leader for "AI for search,"
                but ChatGPT and Claude have both launched their own web search
                capabilities. Anecdotally, I completely stopped using Perplexity
                and switched to ChatGPT's search feature after it launched.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perplexity is now working on their own browser, training their
                own foundational model (Sonar), and the CEO is tweeting about
                funding the creation of a new Mahabharata. These suggest
                desperation and would worry me if I were an investor.
