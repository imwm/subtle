              <p>
                Here's a new thing from me:
                <a
                  href="https://www.clank.email"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                >
                  clank.email</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                This lets you send an email to an address
                (<strong>yo@clank.email</strong>) and get an LLM response back.
              </p>
              <p>
                There have been a number of times when I received an email that
                I wanted to process with an LLM for various reasons. For
                example, I once sent myself a preview of a newsletter draft and
                wanted an LLM to check it for mistakes. Another time, I opened a
                very long thread I hadn't been keeping up with and needed a
                quick summary. It's somewhat cumbersome to expand the entire
                thread, copy the contents, paste them into ChatGPT, get a
                response, and then bring it back to the email. Clank is designed
                to make LLMs accessible directly in-thread.
              </p>
              <p>
                I imagine there are many other use cases for bringing LLM
                functionality into email threads, which is why I built this with
                a reasonably generous free tier (the first 5 emails are free).
                Based on early usage, forwarding emails seems to be the most
                common workflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I set up basic paid plans: $6/month for up to 200 responses, and
                $30/month for effectively unlimited responses. I plan to expand
                the unlimited tier to allow custom instructions, multiple
                originating email addresses, and access to better models. For
                now, these plans exist (1) to test demand and (2) to impose
                usage caps, since OpenAI responses aren't cheap at scale.
              </p>

                This project was made possible by
                <a
                  href="https://resend.com/blog/inbound-emails"
                  target="_blank"

                  >Resend</a
                >'s new Inbound feature, which allows you to listen for webhook
                events triggered by emails sent to your domain. I've had a
                really good experience with Resend and was waiting for this
                feature to build out my idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm using <strong>GPT-5-mini</strong> to generate responses to
                emails, which is fast and affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'll see if this goes anywhere! It was a fun project to build.
