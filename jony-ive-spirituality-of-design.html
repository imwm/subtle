                Jony Ive recently spoke with Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison
                at Stripe's annual conference. Jony oversaw design at Apple in
                its golden age under Steve Jobs.

                is worth watching in full, but this story in particular was
                inspiring (around 11:20):
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <strong>Jony:</strong> I remember working on a Sunday afternoon.
                I was working on some absurd detail in terms of packaging.
                Compared to what you guys do, this will seem so trivial. But I
                had such a clear awareness that in designing a certain solution,
                for example how we managed a cable that's in a box, that
                designing that, I knew that millions of people would engage with
                this little tab. I could either make the cable an easy thing to
                unwrap – sorry that is such a trivial example isn't it.<br /><br />
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> But you can describe the purpose of
                that as it shaves five seconds off the unwrapping of every cable
                and multiply that across however many millions. But I get the
                sense from you that's not why you do it. It's not this
                utilitarian multiplication and calculation – there's something
                spiritual in it for you. What's the spiritual thing?<br /><br />
                <strong>Jony:</strong> I think the spiritual thing is that I
                believe when somebody unwrapped that box and took out that
                cable, they'll think, "Somebody gave a shit about me." I think
                that's a spiritual thing.
              </blockquote>

              <p>He continued:</p>

              <blockquote>
                <strong>Jony:</strong> That Sunday afternoon, when I really
                should've been out with my boys, and I'm worrying about this, I
                did feel a connection and an excitement that somebody was going
                to experience something that they don't even know exists yet.
                Even though it was a small thing, it really did come genuinely
                from a place of love and of care. Steve spoke about this. He
                spoke about it way more eloquently than I can. He talked about,
                when you make something with love and with care, even though the
                people you've made it for, you don't know their story, they
                don't know your story, you'll never even shake their hand, but
                when they use the product that they've made, it's a way – the
                way Steve expressed it, which I thought was so beautiful – it's
                a way of expressing our gratitude to the species. And I thought
                that was such an incredibly thoughtful, beautiful, and authentic
                declaration.
              </blockquote>

                There is a lot of talk about "taste" in software these days.
                Many will claim it, but this story was a great illustration what
                it really takes to produce "tasteful" software.
              </p>
              <p>
                As someone said on X, this isn't a speech from Jony, it's a
                sermon.
