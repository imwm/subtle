                recently:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                If AI makes development easier and faster, why aren’t devs
                building more side projects?
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                More software is being created today than a year ago, as seen in
                the usage and revenue numbers from AI-powered tools like Lovable
                and Replit. I’ve heard countless stories of people using these
                tools to build simple apps for specific personal tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I haven't seen is Cambrian explosion of new,
                production-grade software that’s ready to scale. Why is that?
              </p>
              <p>
                The first answer to Daniel’s question is that most people are
                not entrepreneurial. The median employee clocks in and out,
                collects a paycheck, and spends their free time with family, on
                hobbies, or relaxing. Only a small minority voluntarily take on
                side gigs, let alone build novel software products for a public
                audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, there’s a "last mile" problem between building a
                prototype and shipping a production-grade application. It’s now
                trivial to create a working prototype. Rohan from Cursor shared
                an example
                <a
                  href="https://x.com/TheRohanVarma/status/1988854744022966747"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >on X</a
                >:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                During an enterprise demo today, Composer built the scaffolding
                for an e-commerce app in 5 seconds.<br /><br />
                The entire auditorium couldn’t help but start laughing.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The hard part remains setting up all the things that turn a
                prototype into a production-grade application: scalable
                databases, seamless authentication, payment processing,
                subscription management, account settings, product
                instrumentation, customer support, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are services that make these steps easier, but in a
                post-AI world, these tasks become the new chokepoints, rather
                than building the core product itself. I suspect we'll see
                companies like Lovable and Replit work to automate these aspects
                of software entrepreneurship. They want to have users with apps
                in production making revenue, because such users are far
                stickier than hobbyists.
              </p>
              <p>
                While building a soon-to-be-announced data platform, I’ve
                learned a lot about these aspects of software overhead. I plan
                to write a markdown file to help agents bake standard SaaS best
                practices into future prototypes automatically. Hopefully, this
                will help reduce the duration of the last mile from prototype to
                production.
