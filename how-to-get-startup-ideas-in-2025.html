                about how to get startup ideas.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup
                ideas. It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have
                yourself.
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:
                they're something the founders themselves want, that they
                themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth
                doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began
                this way.
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among
                other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds
                obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And
                yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve
                problems no one has.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                I think this essay's advice is importantly true. The trait
                behind the insightfulness of this essay is psychological
                realism. That's the same trait that makes good entrepreneurs.
                It's not a coincidence Graham is both a great founder and great
                essayist.
              </p>

              <p>
                Graham also coins a new maxim by combining words of wisdom from
                Buchheit and Pirsig: "Live in the future, then build what's
                missing."
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                That describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups
                got started. Neither Apple nor Yahoo nor Google nor Facebook
                were even supposed to be companies at first. They grew out of
                things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the
                world.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                However, there is still a problem for founders who solve their
                own problems:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                How do you tell whether there's a path out of an idea? How do
                you tell whether something is the germ of a giant company, or
                just a niche product? Often you can't. The founders of Airbnb
                didn't realize at first how big a market they were tapping.
                Initially they had a much narrower idea. They were going to let
                hosts rent out space on their floors during conventions. They
                didn't foresee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon
                them gradually. All they knew at first is that they were onto
                something. That's probably as much as Bill Gates or Mark
                Zuckerberg knew at first.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                It's easier than ever to solve your own problems with software
                through vibe coding (<a
                  href="vibe-code-responsibly.html"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >responsibly</a
                >). One might actively have multiple applications running for
                themselves simultaneously. And now you can gauge which product
                might have a path to being a good business. Put a waitlist at
                the bottom of your product, and see which product attracts the
                most signups.
              </p>

              <p>
                Individual builders should have many bespoke products that solve
                their own problems, with each one actively gauging interest.
                They end up with a product portfolio that sort of resembles a
                venture portfolio.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an endnote, this is a very good illustration of the mentality
                behind some bad startup ideas:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                Why do so many founders build things no one wants? Because they
                begin by trying to think of startup ideas. That m.o. is doubly
                dangerous: it doesn't merely yield few good ideas; it yields bad
                ideas that sound plausible enough to fool you into working on
                them.
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                At YC we call these "made-up" or "sitcom" startup ideas. Imagine
                one of the characters on a TV show was starting a startup. The
                writers would have to invent something for it to do. But coming
                up with good startup ideas is hard. It's not something you can
                do for the asking. So (unless they got amazingly lucky) the
                writers would come up with an idea that sounded plausible, but
                was actually bad.
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                For example, a social network for pet owners. It doesn't sound
                obviously mistaken. Millions of people have pets. Often they
                care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them.
                Surely many of these people would like a site where they could
                talk to other pet owners. Not all of them perhaps, but if just 2
                or 3 percent were regular visitors, you could have millions of
                users. You could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge
                for premium features.
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                The danger of an idea like this is that when you run it by your
                friends with pets, they don't say "I would never use this." They
                say "Yeah, maybe I could see using something like that." Even
                when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of
                people. They don't want to use it themselves, at least not right
                now, but they could imagine other people wanting it. Sum that
                reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users.
