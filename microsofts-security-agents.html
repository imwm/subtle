                I think Microsoft has the right idea with their security agents.

                Microsoft said Monday it will soon roll out 11 new AI agents for
                its security-focused Copilot aimed at offloading some of the
                most repetitive tasks that bog down cybersecurity teams.
                <br /><br />
                <b>Why it matters</b>: Microsoft is the latest major vendor to
                embed autonomous AI agents directly into its security suite in
                an effort to reduce burnout for cyber pros and boost efficiency
                through AI-powered automation....

              <blockquote>
                Starting next month, Microsoft will make six of its own new
                agents and five agents from partner companies available for
                preview in Security Copilot — which is already integrated into
                all of Microsoft's security tools.

                  <li class="mb-4">
                    Each agent focuses on a different task: One specifically
                    combs through potential phishing emails. Another can craft
                    notification letters to send to different regulators after a
                    data breach.
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-4">
                    Customers can configure each agent's level of access and
                    autonomy, including whether the agent acts under its own
                    identity (with a unique username and password) or as an
                    extension of a human account.
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-4">
                    Each agent also has a map of its thinking so human users can
                    review their decisions — and even override or correct their
                    selections.

                This could also pose a threat to code agent startups such as
                Cursor and Windsurf, as well as text-to-product interfaces like
                Lovable and Bolt.

                Microsoft has a world class cybersecurity division. If they
                productize their cybersecurity expertise and bundle that into
                their coding agent (Github Copilot), then people who are serious
                about

                This is one specific way in which Cursor, even though it was the
