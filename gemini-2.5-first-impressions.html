                has had this issue where the local API was essentially recreated
                to be compatible with vercel functions which have certain
                idiosyncracies. Sonnet kept struggling with the task of
                consolidating these files and doing overall codebase cleanup.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I selected Gemini 2.5 (Pro Max) and gave it a basic prompt to
                this effect.
              </p>

                  to get pastable plain text of the Vercel function docs for the
                  Cursor agent prompt</i
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Gemini 2.5 responded by asking followups, asking me to point it
                to where to look in the codebase. Once directed, it asked me a
                few more clarifying and orientational questions before calling
                any tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once it got going, it reached several "Decision Points," where
                it presented me with several courses of action.
              </p>
              <p>
                I suspect Gemini 2.5's emphasis on table-setting and greater
                deference to the user reflects Google's general ethic of
                caution.
              </p>
              <p>
                This specific project involved consolidating a lot of the API
                functionality to use the more Vercel-specific implementation,
                which included deleting a lot of files. Based on my experience
                of Gemini 2.5 being quite cautious and deliberative before
                taking action, I suspect it's the best model for this kind of
                refactoring / cleanup project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gemini 2.5's text generation felt slower than Sonnet (3.7) has
                in the past (though Gemini may be getting a lot of traffic right
                now). When Cursor isn't experiencing peak traffic, Sonnet's
                responses flow super quickly.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's like you want Sonnet (3.7) to be your writer, generating
                files quickly, and then Gemini (2.5) is your editor or technical
                architect.
              </p>

                Seems like some users of Cline are adopting this kind of
                functionality:

                  Introducing model switching in Cline. Use different models for
                  different tasks - Sonnet for quick generation, Gemini for

                Finally, while Cursor always prompts you to start a new chat
                after a certain number of exchanges, I found that in a very long
                chat with Gemini 2.5 (Pro Max), it kept going no problem. This
                may have something to do with its stated 1-million token context
                window.
