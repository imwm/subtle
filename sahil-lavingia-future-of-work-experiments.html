                founders, because such founders don't necessarily need to aim

                <b>Transparency:</b> Sahil writes in a lowkey, casual way that
                is refreshing. For example, in the blog post above, he says:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                I think our equity model is cool. My mom thinks it is confusing.
                Others, like my wife, see anything that is not a direct cash
                payment as a Ponzi scheme. This is my best attempt at explaining
                Gumroad's approach to equity, and the history behind it, so you
                can decide for yourself.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                He also conducts quarterly board meetings in public where he
                shares company financials and usage data.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>No Meetings, No Deadlines</b>: This is maybe my favorite
                thing. Meetings suck. Deadlines are recipes for disaster.
                Nonetheless, meetings and deadlines are endemic plagues at
                software firms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Writing and videos (like Looms) are vastly better than meetings.
                Deadlines are usually arbitrary; users don't care what date a
                feature is released, just that it's good.
              </p>

              <p>
                We'll see how Antiwork progresses, but I'm excited to see
                someone experimenting so widely and openly.
