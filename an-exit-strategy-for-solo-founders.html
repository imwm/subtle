                Josh Mohrer was on the Generative Now podcast recently and
                floated an exit strategy for solo founders (<a
                  href="https://youtu.be/ooHo3I75pOA?si=IjBygpxzNLT9hdq6&t=1880"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >around 31:00</a
                >).
              </p>
              <p>
                While solo ventures that are making money can become profitable
                quickly, at some point you may want to sell your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                It might be beacuse you're ready to move on to the next thing.
                It could also be because you know the project has room to grow,
                but you don't want to be the person to raise the money, hire the
                team, build the culture, set up the processes, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                So it could make sense to sell your profitable, bootstrapped
                product to a company whose existing team can take it to the next
                level.
              </p>

                I think this is a playbook mid- and late-stage startups should
                heavily consider for a couple reasons:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Startups are increasingly stalling out at earlier ARR points
                  (as Jason Lemkin
                  <a
                    href="https://x.com/jasonlk/status/1903522831855673760"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    >has noted</a
                  >). To avoid revenue stall, they'll have to go multi-product
                  sooner. This means being more acquisitive earlier on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The widespread availability of code generation tools means
                  that there will be more software competing with your product.
                  This will increase pressure for software businesses to
                  diversify their revenue streams.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I imagine solo founders will be willing to sell their
                  businesses at valuations lower than historical venture-backed
                  exits, because they don't have investors to answer to, and
                  they'll receive the lion's share if not all of the exit
                  proceeds.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                An implication of this is that we may see startups introducing
                M&A functions earlier and earlier. Maybe that's where all the
                former VCs will land.
              </p>
