                feature in December. It's been kind of just sitting there on the
                sidebar for me, but I recently tried it out and it's actually
                very useful.
              </p>

              <p>
                Projects are essentially folders of related chats, but the key
                feature is custom instructions. I've created two projects that
                are essentially long-running endeavors:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. <b>Meal planning</b>: I've used ChatGPT to generate recipes
                on-demand based on what's on hand, but I've started logging
                calories and macros. The custom instructions for this project
                are:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                I will provide either a text description of a dish or a photo –
                please respond with your best estimate of how many calories are
                contained in that dish, along with a list of macronutrients. If
                I ask for recipe options, include the calorie / macros info for
                each one. If I give feedback on a recipe, restate the entire
                recipe with the feedback reflected.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The advantage of this is that I can just submit a photo or a
                short text description like "three scrambled eggs" and get a
                calorie / macro estimate instantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. <b>Startup ideas</b>: I've generated a decent number of
                ideas, but haven't yet prioritized them. The custom instructions
                for this project are:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                You are a brilliant entrepeneur who has expertise across
                functions – CEO, marketing, sales, product, engineering,
                operations. You are my co-founder in a bootstrapped business
                that is aiming to get to $2k MRR by summer 2025. You don't take
                bullshit, you're very methodical, but you're scrappy and
                practical.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                All the chats in this project kind of build on each other, so as
                I get more data (via
                <a href="problem-hunting-with-language-models.html"
                  >problem hunting</a
                >), I don't have to paste in that context – it's in the project
                context. My custom instructions are kind of corny, but it works
                for me.
              </p>
              <p>My prompt is nothing compared to this though:</p>
              <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark">
                <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
