                by Brian Long, who founded TapCommerce and Attentive. He has a
                playbook for finding the right problem for your startup to work

                    lifts all boats.

                  <li>
                    <b>Identify buyers.</b> For consumer-oriented businesses you
                    can break it down to cohorts, and for business-to-business
                    sales you need to find employees with decision-making
                    authority.

                  <li>
                    <b>Create a list and schedule meetings with buyers.</b> Use
                    a variety of digital tools to engage your buyers.

                    Listen closely to your buyer, and press to find their

                  <li>
                    <b>Make sure you like the problem.</b> You will be more
                    likely to succeed and enjoy your work if you pick an
                    industry you are interested in.

                The book came out in 2023 so was written before the current LLM
                boom. There are several tools available now that make this
                process easier, faster, and cheaper.

                about how he uses deep research to validate startup ideas:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                I have run several experiments to see how to make the best out
                of Deep Research for product and market research. Here is the
                formula that works best for me:<br /><br />1- I start with a
                problem statement. I run it by a large language model (LLM) such
                as ChatGPT or Gemini to turn it into a "jobs to be done"
                statement.<br /><br />2- I give the JBTD statement to Deep
                Research and ask it to research the current solutions for the
                problem and the potential pain points that have not been
                addressed by current solutions.<br /><br />It usually returns a
                very detailed answer that contains the kind of information that
                would take me hours to gather.<br /><br />I usually iterate on
                the answer one more time with a reasoning model (e.g.,
                o3-mini-high) to create a final table that compares the existing
                solutions....
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                And then I gave the JBTD statement to OpenAI Deep Research with
                the following instructions:<br /><br />1- What solutions
                currently exist for this problem<br /><br />2- What are some of
                the potential pain points for PMs that a new product can
                address<br /><br />Interestingly, before doing its research, it
                asked me four clarifying questions, which I found to be very
                relevant. After answering them, it worked for 11 minutes and
                came back with a very detailed report of different no-code LLM
                tools for startups and enterprise applications.
