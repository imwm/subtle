                I built a new product called
                <a
                  href="https://www.agenticequities.com/"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors"
                >
                  Agentic Equities</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                The motivating observation is that more and more people are
                turning to ChatGPT for financial advice. Specifically, they're
                asking ChatGPT what stocks to buy in general, and what it thinks
                about certain stocks in particular.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agentic Equities queries the underlying OpenAI models for
                ratings of the S&amp;P 500 and select other stocks. The result
                is a list of stocks ranked by OpenAI's 12-month outlook for the
                share price and overall rating (buy/hold/sell).
              </p>
              <p class="font-semibold mb-1">How it works:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                  I gathered an initial set of 500+ stocks—company names and
                  stock symbols.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I set up a script to fetch the latest prices of those stocks
                  from AlphaVantage (first) and Yahoo Finance (as a fallback).
                </li>
                <li>
                  I wrote a general prompt for OpenAI to search for information
                  relevant to a certain stock and return a response in a
                  specific format: buy/hold/sell rating, a 12-month price
                  target, and a brief memo explaining its reasoning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I wrote seven specific prompts for "analyst personas," where
                  each prompt describes a different investment philosophy. You
                  can read those specific prompts
                  <a
                    href="https://agenticequities.substack.com/i/170456656/how-it-works"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors"
                  >
                    here</a
                  >.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then I set up a Next.js app with Supabase to display the
                  results generated by these scripts in a table that orders
                  results by upside (descending), where upside is the simple
                  ratio of GPT price target to current stock price.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I run the market price update script daily after market close,
                  and I run the GPT ratings fetch weekly on Thursdays after
                  market close. (That GPT script generates seven ratings for 530
                  stocks each, or 3,710 separate OpenAI calls using
                  <code>gpt-4o-search-preview-2025-03-11</code>, which adds up
                  to about $100 per run.)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This project was partly inspired by Bloomberg writer Matt
                Levine's observations about how retail trading may be
                increasingly directed by ChatGPT. I sent the project to Matt a
                couple of days after I built it, and he covered it
                <a
                  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-08-07/401-k-plans-will-get-more-fun"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors"
                >
                  in his August 7 newsletter</a
                >, which to date has driven about 6,000 visitors to the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Levine covered the site, I quickly set up
                <a
                  href="https://agenticequities.substack.com"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors"
                >
                  a Substack
                </a>
                for people to sign up for updates. I now send that newsletter on
                Fridays after the new weekly GPT ratings come in. You can find
                some early observations based on the data there.
              </p>
              <p class="font-semibold mb-1">What's next:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>
                  This week, I'm going to adopt GPT-5, which is the new default
                  model in ChatGPT. I'll probably migrate the existing analyst
                  personas over to GPT-5, though I may leave a couple on the
                  previous model as a kind of control to compare different model
                  behaviors. GPT-5 is about half the price of
                  <code>gpt-4o-search-preview-2025-03-11</code>, which is nice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I'm also planning to look into the main hypothesis
                  <a
                    href="https://agenticequities.substack.com/p/agentic-equities-one-week-in"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors"
                  >
                    I wrote about in the Substack last week</a
                  >
                  —that GPT ratings have built-in volatility because of the way
                  LLMs use a technique called sampling. I'm planning to gather
                  ratings for one stock over a discrete time period and compare
                  those ratings' variance to the market price variance. My
                  hypothesis is that the GPT variance will be significantly
                  higher than the price variance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I've also received some inbounds from people in finance who
                  are interested in exploring various directions for this
                  project.
                </li>
