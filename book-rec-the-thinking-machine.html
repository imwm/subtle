                by Stephen Witt. I learned a lot about Jensen, Nvidia, the
                history of GPUs, machine learning, and more. Here are a few
                takeaways:

              Jensen (and his wife, Lori) almost died in a car accident in 1984,
              years before he co-founded Nvidia:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Jensen hit the transparent layer of black ice that coated the
              freeway and sent the Supra into an unrecoverable glide. The tires
              spun without purpose, and the vehicle drifted onto the shoulder
              before rolling off the road. Jensen and Lori were momentarily
              inverted. Then the car hit the ground with an awful crunch before
              banging along to a stop.... The Supra was totaled, and the couple
              was trapped inside. Lori, wearing her new engagement ring, was
              mostly unharmed. Jensen was bleeding, and his neck was twisted
              bad.... When the first responders eventually arrived, they had to
              cut the couple out of the car. Jensen required stitches in
              multiple places and had to wear a neck brace for several months
              thereafter. When I asked him about the incident years later, he
              mostly expressed regret for the Supra. "Incredible car," he said.

              Nvidia went public in 1999 at a $600M valuation, but there wasn't
              a party, or popped champagne. One employee saved an email Jensen
              sent him the day after the IPO:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              The TNT2 team needs to do whatever it takes to get over the finish
              line. They're fighting for every single minute within Dell and
              Compaq for the motherboard business. S3's Savage 4s are working
              well on Camino, but we're still struggling. There's no more time.
              Do what it takes to get it done. We need design wins to take share
              from ATI and keep S3 down, and take Nvidia to the next level.
              Remember, there are three priorities: one, two, and three. We're
              counting on 250,000 units of TNT2 shipments by April to make our
              Q1. Do that and we've got to cert risk wafers accordingly. Get it
              done.

              Nvidia hit some stumbles in the early 2000s, including an
              accounting scandal, a lost deal with Xbox, and the famous
              "dustbuster" GeForce FX with a deafening fan. The latter event was
              one of many occasions for Jensen tearing into employees in large
              meetings:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Huang arranged a meeting in which the product managers presented,
              to a few hundred people, every decision they had made that led to
              the fiasco. Huang then screamed at them, near the top of his
              voice, for nearly an hour. "'Terrifying but cathartic' is how I
              would describe it," said Sharon Clay, one of the engineers
              responsible for quality control. Huang's tirades inspired as much
              guilt as fear, and he often described, in detail, how in letting
              their customers down, Nvidia employees had let one another's
              families down as well. ("I think I'm driven as much by guilt as
              anything else," Huang told me.)
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Despite his temper, Jensen would rarely fire people. Tenure of
              Nvidia employees was significantly higher than many other
              companies in Silicon Valley. Jensen would make personal appeals to
              even low-ranking employees to keep them at Nvidia.

              Compute Unified Device Architecture, or CUDA, is a proprietary
              Nvidia platform that originally enabled developers to use the GPU,
              previously built exclusively for 3D graphics, for general purpose
              computing. This is what eventually allowed Nvidia chips to
              accelerate the field of machine learning. But it was a longshot
              bet, and led to an activist investor attempting to force Jensen
              out as CEO.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, two longshot subfields of computer science proved
              correct: parallel processing and machine learning. Had either of
              these not materialized, Nvidia would not be the company it is
              today.
            </p>

              Nvidia's gains in processing speeds across the 2010s and into the
              2020s really came more from
              <i>software innovations</i> than hardware advancements:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Only a small portion of the performance gains now came from the
              classic strategy of packing more transistors into the chipâ€”Moore's
              Law was dead. The rest came from... Nvidia scientists accelerating
              matrix multiplications with numerical magic tricks. Nvidia
              engineers taught the GPU new instructions that acted like speed
              solvers on a Rubik's cube. They replaced the processor's native
              language with ugly but effective lo-fi data types, akin to
              switching from calligraphy to shorthand. They trimmed 'dead'
              synapses from the matrices, essentially deleting unproductive
              information from the neural net in the manner of the forgetting
              machine in <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>. Between
              2012 and 2022, Nvidia achieved a thousand-fold speedup in
              single-chip AI inference performance, which was far in excess of
              anything that Moore's Law had ever achieved. A mere 2.5x of that
              speed-up came from transistors; most of the remaining 400x came
              from Nvidia's mathematical toolbox.
