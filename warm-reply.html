                I've been sending cold emails to generate leads for various
                products, but ran into issues. My first campaign got my main
                <a
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  href="https://www.substats.io"

                  >Substats</a
                >
                email flagged and for two days everything I sent went to spam.
                Searching for contacts in
                <a
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"

                and similar products yielded poor results and had a subpar UX. I
                wanted something I could put on autopilot that prioritized
                quality over quantity and sent messages that weren't slop.

                When thinking about how to price it – in case others find it as
                useful as I do – I wanted there to be minimal friction to get
                started. I also like outcome-based pricing especially for AI
                products (shout out to
                <a

                for that one).
              </p>
              <p>
                So the product is mainly priced around
                <span class="font-semibold">warm replies</span>. It's free to
                add your own contacts, generate personalized emails, and send –
                you're only charged when you get a warm reply.
              </p>
              <p>
                This kind of pricing model wasn't really feasible before. Our
                system receives replies (via Resend's
                <a
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  href="https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/receiving/introduction"

                  rel="noopener"
                  >Inbound feature</a
                >), and gpt-5-mini classifies it as a warm reply or not. Then
                the reply is delivered to the original sender, who can take it
                from there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Data storage and email sending is extremely cheap, so it's fine
                for those aspects of the product to be free.
              </p>
              <p>
                The non-cheap part is contact retrieval. Data providers such as
                <a

                >
                (which Warm Reply uses and which also powers Clay) charge
                upwards of $0.30 per contact. Warm Reply offers 10 free contacts
                to new users and then each marginal contact is effectively sold
                at cost.

                  >(Hopefully as Warm Reply usage grows, we can benefit from
                  volume discounts and pass those cost savings onto our
                  customers.)</span

                This was fun to build not just because I'm actually using it
                every weekday to power cold outreach but also because I got to
                build an information-dense UI that suits my personal tastes.
                It's probably not for everyone, but it's what I like. Will be
                writing more about these hypersonal UIs soon.
