                On paper Windsurf doesn't seem that hard to build - just fork VS
                Code, add an agent, some autocomplete, and indexing. It's
                surprising that OpenAI, a $300B company, isn't just doing this
                themselves.

                <a

                  >The Modern AI Workspace</a
                >
                offers an explanation for why OpenAI might really be interested
                in this kind of acquisition (he only talks about Cursor, but it
                applies to Windsurf as well):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                Traditional productivity tools like Microsoft Office, Google
                Workspace, or Notion are powerful, but they lack something
                crucial: an AI that can take direct action on your files and
                folders.<br /><br />

                This is where Cursor shines in unexpected ways.<br /><br />

                By opening a root workspace folder in Cursor for your daily
                non-coding tasks (be it writing, research, project management,
                or content creation), you're essentially giving an AI assistant
                direct access to help organize, edit, and enhance your
                work....<br /><br />
                Cursor's built-in Git integration offers another significant
                advantage, especially in content writing contexts. Even for
                non-coders, Git allows you to track every change to your
                documents, revert to previous versions when needed, and maintain
                a complete history of your work....<br /><br />
                As AI agents continue to evolve, the lines between coding and
                non-coding tools can and will blur. Cursor (and Windsurf)
                represents an early example of what's possible when we expand
                our thinking about development tools beyond their original
                purpose.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                In other words, Cursor and Windsurf aren't just good developer
                tools; they could potentially become the AI-powered workspaces
                of the future, beginning with code but expanding to everything
                we do on our computers.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are already real examples of this expansion. The Pragmatic
                Engineer

                about hooking up a Windsurf MCP server to PostgreSQL. Then he
                could use Windsurf to ask his database questions:

                <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                  <li>
                    "Has there been an unusual spike of signups the last 2
                    months?"

                  <li>
                    "Which suspicious-looking emails have signed up recently?
                    Any patterns?"

                  <li>"How many unclaimed promo codes are left?"</li>
                </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Windsurf would not be the first developer-oriented tool to
                become a mainstream application. IRC was used by nerds and
                gamers until Slack made it pretty and turned it into a $27
                billion business (Discord later did something similar).

                made another good point about why OpenAI might want Windsurf –
                the usage data from users interacting with models. Just like
                with ChatGPT, collecting feedback on how users interact with
                models is gold. Windsurf's usage data could help OpenAI's models
                catch up to Anthropic's on coding benchmarks.

              <p>The competitive landscape is getting messy:</p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  GitHub Copilot just launched agent mode – so Microsoft now is
                  directly competing with Cursor and Windsurf.
                </li>
                <li>
                  OpenAI's startup fund is invested in Cursor – but now they're
                  buying their #1 competitor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Microsoft's invested heavily in OpenAI – but their Copilot
                  product competes directly with Cursor and Windsurf.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Oh, and VS Code (Microsoft's baby) is the open source
                  foundation of both Cursor and Windsurf.
