                A common pain point working with code generation tools like
                Cursor is that with every new chat, the agent needs to scan the
                code base to get context. The agent acts as though it's never
                seen this codebase before, even if it wrote every line of it.
                It's as if every day that an engineer showed up to work, they
                had to first sit through new hire orientation, peruse all the
                readmes, and internalize the organization's software development
                processes before writing a single line of code.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best way I've found to mitigate this is to include a product
                requirements doc (PRD) as a markdown file in the repo. This
                <code>prd.md</code> file allows the agent to quickly catch up on
                what we're building.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like in human collaboration, good documentation matters.
                The difference is agents are amnesiacs (for now).

                goes a few steps further, recommending that you also include:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <b>App Flow Doc</b>: Descriptions of user stories and flows
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Tech Stack Doc</b>: List of technologies used (and perhaps
                  ones to avoid)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Frontend Guidelines</b>: Fonts, color scheme, icon set,
                  etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Backend Structure Doc</b>: DB schema, API spec, auth flow,
                  etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Implementation Plan</b>: List of steps the agent should
                  take
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I don't agree with the last one – the agent should be able to
                figure that out on its own. And by listing the implementation
                steps you overprescribe what the agent does – perhaps the agent
                has a better plan. In that case, since LLMs are trained to be so
                agreeable, they will take the stupider path i.e. yours.
              </p>
              <p>
                And aside from <code>prd.md</code>, I'm not sure the user should
                be generating these docs. If the user has strong opinions about
                tech stack, specify those up front when the app is initialized.
                But you probably just want to ask the agent itself to create and
                update this documentation as it goes.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this technique catches on – a <code>prd.md</code> file that
                governs the agent's behavior – then I foresee a few further
                implications. From nearer- to longer-term:
              </p>

                <li>
                  Product documentation should really live in the codebase. In
                  my experience it's always instead lived in Google Docs,
                  Notion, etc. As agents contribute more to codebases, they'll
                  need direct access to the product specs. What better place
                  than in the codebase itself?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bundling product specs with the codebase will invite coding
                  agents to contribute more to product management. Give agents
                  access to product usage data and user feedback, and they can
                  start autonomously opening PRs on the product spec itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Taken to its extreme, we'll see the role of humans being (1)
                  product conception, i.e. conceiving of awesome, novel products
                  and initializing them and (2) orchestrating product
                  development agents that ship, observe, deliberate, iterate,
                  and repeat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A question is where that orchestration will happen. Linear
                  today announced that

                  >
                  – just assign an issue to an agent and then review their work.
                  I suspect Github actually might end up being the winner,
                  because it's the single source of truth for code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The other opportunity that's interesting is how to make
                  product usage data and user feedback accessible and optimized
                  for agents. And developing agents that can intelligently go
                  from those raw inputs to successful product iterations. I
                  could see Amplitude or Atlassian going after this.
