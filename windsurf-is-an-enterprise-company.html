                particular.
              </p>

              <p>
                Lenny asked Varun what distinguishes Windsurf from other code
                generation companies such as Cursor and Lovable. Varun said:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                On the product side, I think we've invested a lot in making sure
                codebase understanding for very large codebases is really high
                quality. That's because of where we started. We worked with some
                of the world's largest companies like Dell and JPMorgan Chase.
                Companies like Dell have singular codebases that over a hundred
                million lines of code. Being able to understand that really
                quickly to make large-scale changes is something that we spent a
                lot of time doing. That requires us to build our own models that
                can consume large chunks of their codebase in parallel across
                thousands of GPUs and almost rank them to find out what the most
                important snippets of code are for any question that's asked
                about the codebase. We've gone out and built out large
                distributed systems based on our infrastructure background to do
                that. That's one....<br /><br />
                The second key piece is we're not only tied to Windsurf....
                We're pretty focused on supporting IDEs like JetBrains.
                JetBrains has over 70-80% of Java developers. The reason we
                don't feel as big a need to almost build a competing product to
                JetBrains is JetBrains is a very extensible product in a way
                that VSCode is not. VSCode is not very extensible. For us, our
                goal here is not just to satisfy a subset of users who can
                switch to our IDE, but we want to give this agentic experience
                to every sort of developer out there. If that means there are
                Java developers who write in JetBrains, that's fine. We work
                with a lot of large enterprises who have 10,000+ developers
                where over 50% of those developers are on JetBrains. It's a very
                large product. By the way, that company is a privately held
                company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It's
                a very large company. That's another key piece. We actually want
                to meet developers where they are. If they use a different
                platform, we'll work on that too.<br /><br />
                Another key piece for enterprises is that we work in a lot of
                very secure environments. We have FedRAMP for certain clients,
                which means we can sell to very large government entities. We
                have a hybrid mode of using the product which means that all the
                code that is indexed actually lives on the tenant of the user.
                Code is one of the most important pieces of IP for these
                companies.<br /><br />
                So if you were to look at it from a big company perspective,
                there are many reasons why over the years of just building an
                enterprise product, we've handled a lot of complexities that
                large companies want to see.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                This was news to me because I've seen Cursor and Windsurf
                discussed more or less interchangeably. And it's impressive that
                Windsurf has gotten so much consumer word of mouth, when it's
                really an enterprise company.
              </p>

              <p>
                In another part of the conversation, Varun talks about how they
                built out a go-to-market team (GTM) early. In fact, as a company
                of 150 people, most of their employees (80) are in sales.
              </p>

              <p>
                So yeah Windsurf is an enterprise company, which is probably
                good for their revenue retention. Glean appears to be pursuing a
                similar market position.
