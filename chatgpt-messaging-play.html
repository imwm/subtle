                Zach Weinberg, who founded Flatiron Health and Curie Bio,
                floated an interesting idea for OpenAI in a podcast today
                (1:07:17):

                After a discussion of the risk of competing with Android/iOS's
                expected free native AI chat, he says:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                If I were in charge of product at OpenAI, I would be thinking
                about non-monetary lock-ins. If I'm going to compete with free,
                I better have some lock-in value that isn't just essentially a
                high quality search query.... <br /><br />I'm going to kill
                myself for saying this, but I think it has to be social
                networking. I think you need some reason that it makes it hard
                for you to leave OpenAI / ChatGPT, even if something else is
                cheap or free. And if the tool is utilitarian, which it kind of
                is today – find something, make an image, do a query... that's
                switchable, because if you can just do it cheaper over here,
                people will switch.<br /><br />If I have friends and social and
                sharing and something native – I actually think I would go after
                messaging inside of ChatGPT. I think people would message in the
                way they do inside of Bloomberg Chat. I think you can backdoor
                an interesting messaging platform there. Then the threat of free
                from Google and Apple, I'm less concerned about because there's
                real lock-in.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                How switching costs work with AI products is an open question.
                We discussed that in a recent post about
                <a
                  href="https://subtle.so/what-is-good-ai-revenue.html"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >what is "good" AI revenue</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zach makes a good point though about competing with free: it's
                hard to do. Google has its own competitive foundational models,
                and will surely make Gemini (or AI Mode or AI Workbench or
                DeepMind or another of their 100 user-facing AI brands) a
                first-class experience on Android. Apple is behind but they will
                find a way to catch up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once that happens, ChatGPT Premium suddenly is faced with
                good-enough free alternatives that are installed by default on
                every Android and iOS device. The two ways to compete are (1)
                lean into your own free option (and run ads), or (2) create
                non-monetary lock-in in your paid tier. Zach advocates ChatGPT
                messaging as the way to achieve (2).
              </p>
              <p>I can see user-to-user messaging working in ChatGPT:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  It's already a messaging app – just limited to you and GPT.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GPT-4o's images are shared like crazy on
                  <i>other</i> networks, such as Twitter – native sharing would
                  be lower-friction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can imagine ways that an LLM embedded in peer-to-peer
                  chats could be helpful, such as group chat summaries, smart
                  notifications, and suggested replies.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>I asked ChatGPT (4.5) for risks:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Moderation could quickly become tricky once human-to-human
                  conversations happen inside the platform
                </li>
                <li>
                  Privacy implications—right now, users feel their conversations
                  are relatively private, adding social would shift user
                  perception
                </li>
                <li>
                  Could dilute the core experience if done badly (users might
                  feel spammed or distracted)
                </li>
              </ul>
