                Agency and taste are buzzwords these days, but their popularity
                hints at how the creative process is changing across many
                domains.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a quick definition, "taste" here means the degree to which
                someone appreciates the quality and quantity of details that
                make up excellent work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Agency and taste matter for creative work because without them,
                you get what's now popularly known as slop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sci-fi writer Ted Chiang recently explained why this is. In an
                essay in the
                <a
                  href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  ><i>New Yorker</i></a
                >, he noted that when AI models are prompted to write a story or
                generate an image, they reflect the average choices that a
                skilled writer or artist would make to deliver on that prompt.
              </p>
              <p>
                Art, Chiang writes, is the sum of innumerable decisions made
                during the creative process. It might look something like this:
              </p>
              <img
                class="w-full -mx-4 -mt-4"
                src="public/creative-model-1.png"
              />
              <p>
                These decision points amount to moments of expression of the
                creator's agency and taste. High-agency creators with taste make
                unique and surprising choices, which often can result in the
                best art.
              </p>
              <p>
                But by outsourcing these decision points to AI models, Chiang
                argues, one creates slop by auto-applying the default or median
                decision across the board.
              </p>
              <img
                class="w-full -mx-4 -mt-4"
                src="public/creative-model-2.png"
              />
              <p>
                While AI tools can certainly make for slop, I would argue that
                the best creative tools will enhance creative expression.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a classic talk,
                <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdP2Bmieg&ab_channel=ColinMcDonnell"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"

                  >Bret Victor</a
                >
                noted that creators need direct relationships with the media
                they create. He distinguished between engineering and
                authorship:
              </p>
              <p>
                Engineering is the act of manipulating an indirect
                representation of the final product, usually code or schematics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Authorship is the act of manipulating a direct representation of
                the final product, such as composing a word document.
              </p>
              <p>
                Authorship, Victor argues, is a superior mode of creation,
                because the creator can make decisions throughout the creative
                process with high-resolution perception of the consumer's
                ultimate experience. They're given a lot of empathy for what the
                end user will ultimately think and feel about the work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The real promise of new creative tools, then, is not just to
                save time for creators. The promise is to give more creators
                high-fidelity representations of the end work throughout the
                creative process, from idea to distribution. This will allow
                creators to better express agency and taste.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, this may explain why new AI tools have excelled in
                certain domains but not in others. AI writing tools, for
                example, have not exploded in popularity, as Lex founder Nathan
                Baschez recently noted. However, AI coding tools (Cursor,
                Lovable), AI video tools (Runway, Sora), and AI music tools
                (Suno) have taken off.
              </p>
              <p>
                I suspect this is because word processors already offer a
                reasonably high-fidelity representation of end user experiences.
                Compare that to coding â€“ that's why products like Cursor and
                Lovable feel like magic.
