                When you're working for a company, your compensation is
                typically a salary and maybe a bonus and/or stock options.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                From the perspective of naked self-interest, an employee in this
                position should optimize their performance for the arbiters of
                this compensation, namely the managers who run performance
                reviews.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Sometimes there is alignment between doing great work and the
                perspectives of company managers.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                But often, companies develop many competing considerations and
                internal prerogatives that cloud managers' judgment when it
                comes to great work.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                In one person teams, however, the only priority is customer
                service. Compensation in one person teams is exactly company
                revenue, and that revenue is entirely determined by customers.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Thus in one person teams, compensation is set by customers,
                rather than managers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solo team structure offers a purer reward function for
                builders.
