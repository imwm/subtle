                We're doing lead gen for Flow State sponsorships, and
                <a
                  href="https://clay.com"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >Clay</a
                >
                is really good.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earlier this year they raised a
                <a
                  href="https://www.clay.com/blog/series-b-expansion"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >"pre-emptive Series B expansion"</a
                >
                at a $1.25B valuation. We decided to give it a shot.
              </p>
              <p>
                The "people finder" tool was really intuitive and customizable:
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="public/clay-screen-1.png" alt="Clay screen 1" />
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two interesting things about Clay. First, and most
                interestingly, they use various datasources to maximize the
                chances of getting a working work email. Specifically, they use
                these seven providers by default:
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="public/clay-screen-2.png" alt="Clay screen 2" />
              </p>
              <p>
                We'd previously tried using hunter.io and it was good, but Clay
                is built on top of 100+ datasets, so you get the best of them
                all. It's a classic example of "<a
                  href="https://gwern.net/complement"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >commoditizing your complements</a
                >."
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, they have AI features integrated into the spreadsheet.
                So you can create a column that uses an LLM and a prompt to fill
                in its values. For example, you can create a column that
                searches the web for a company attribute like founding date, or
                what their latest product announcement was:
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="public/clay-screen-3.png" alt="Clay screen 3" />
              </p>
              <p>
                They're also pretty generous with their free trial. You can make
                multiple sheets and export 100 companies or people at a time.
              </p>
              <p>
                They also have a lot of integrations and some built-in messaging
                functionality, but we have yet to try those out.
              </p>
              <p>But yeah. Pretty good product!</p>
