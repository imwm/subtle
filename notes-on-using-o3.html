              <p>OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/" target="_blank" class="underline hover:opacity-75">launched</a> their o3 model last week, on April 16. Tyler Cowen <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/04/o3-and-agi-is-april-16th-agi-day.html" target="_blank" class="underline hover:opacity-75">called it</a> AGI:</p>
              <blockquote>
                I think it is AGI, seriously.  Try asking it lots of questions, and then ask yourself: just how much smarter was I expecting AGI to be?<br /><br />

                As I've argued in the past, AGI, however you define it, is not much of a social event per se.  It still will take us a long time to use it properly.  I do not expect securities prices to move significantly (that AI is progressing rapidly already is priced in, and I doubt if the market cares about "April 16th" per se).<br /><br />

                Benchmarks, benchmarks, blah blah blah.  Maybe AGI is like porn — I know it when I see it.<br /><br />

                And I've seen it.
              </blockquote>
              <p>Whether or not a given model is AGI is a semantic question. It's clear we're in the age of AGI, in that computers are rapidly surpassing humans at many tasks.</p>
              <p>I wanted to share a few observations about using o3 on a more practical level.</p>
              <p>I asked it to brainstorm approaches to the project idea that eventually became <a href="/distilljs" class="underline hover:opacity-75">DistillJS</a>. It began with:</p>
              <blockquote>
                0. double check the ROI. if you only call the api a few hundred times a month, shipping a local model may not pencil out. bandwidth + user download time + your build effort can outrun token fees.
              </blockquote>
              <p>Listing this as suggestion "0" is hilarious. Suggestions 1-5 reflected deep technical knowledge and creative problem-solving, but it began the list by basically suggesting it was a dumb idea in the first place.</p>
              <p>In its suggestions, o3 referenced a few technologies and concepts – e.g. ONNX, LoRA – that I wasn't familiar with. In certain moments I felt like Theodore Twombly during this scene in <i>Her</i>:</p>
              <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ku858jn0Qzc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="mb-4"></iframe>
              <p>In general, o3 is pretty verbose. It's like it's proud of its knowledge. It's kind of a showboat.</p>
              <p>And in fact, even though it generated significant proofs of knowledge, it didn't really engage my curiosity the way a normal back-and-forth with models like GPT-4 did.</p>
              <p>With GPT-4 and similar models oriented toward back-and-forth, I've gone down many rabbit holes and learned about all kinds of things, like a more productive version of a Wikipedia rabbit hole.</p>
              <p>With o3, I felt like I was just getting high-quality answers to my questions rather than being engaged.</p>
              <p>It's like GPT-4 was geared toward dialogue and o3 is geared toward monologue.</p>
