                What a subject! It makes capitalism happen. But for some people
                – like me – it's nerve-wracking. Here's how I approach asking
                people for money (for a product).
              </p>

              <p>
                In the first place, you don't know if your product is valuable
                unless you ask people to pay for it. As someone recently told
                me, "There's an infinite difference between a product that's
                free and one that costs $10."
              </p>

              <p>
                When you ask someone to pay for your product, it switches their
                mental gears. They enter a different mindset when their money's
                on the line. They give you a more honest assessment.
              </p>

              <p>
                So the first reason to ask people for money is that it elicits a
                better signal on your product's value.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you accept that you should ask people to pay for your
                product, you need to then ask people to pay for your product.
                This can be uncomfortable.
              </p>

              <p>Here's my playbook for asking for money as an introvert:</p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Do casual price discovery with friendlies who resemble your
                  ICP. Have catchup calls, bring up the product, present a
                  price, and get their reaction. You can be honest about being
                  uncomfortable asking people for money and being unsure about
                  the price, because they're friendly. If you don't have anyone
                  to do this,
                  <a
                    href="mailto:hi@subtle.so"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    >email me</a
                  >.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Look at your competitors. Arrive at a price that's reasonable
                  for the product you're offering. Justify the price to yourself
                  – if you were in the buyer's shoes, it should seem reasonable.
                  Sleep on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When you then talk to potential customers, share the price
                  like you share other information about the product. It's just
                  information. The early convos with your friendly ICPs and your
                  personal justification of the price should inure you to nerves
                  in this moment.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                A couple other tips on this moment of truth, from Sales 101:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <b>Anchoring.</b> Cite a future price or the price of a
                  competitor, and then undercut it significantly. Put a higher
                  price in their mind, then offer your real price. That makes it
                  feel cheap.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Urgency.</b> There's a limited set of seats for this deal.
                  The window for this deal closes end of month. Give the buyer a
                  reason they need to sign now and not kick the can down the
                  road, as anyone is inclined to do.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Anyway, that's my take so far as a complete novice to sales. As
                Ken Griffin said,
                <a
                  href="/if-were-all-gonna-eat-someone-has-to-sell.html"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >If we're all gonna eat, someone has to sell.</a
                >
