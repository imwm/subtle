                On (1), one big thing that Windsurf does that ChatGPT doesn't is
                connect to a file system and manipulate it directly, with
                version control. Buying Windsurf would bring them this
                capability. (Read more about this

                  a direct integration between Github and its Deep Research
                  tool. While the best use case for this seems to be creating
                  robust documentation on-demand, it hints at a deeper
                  integration whereby ChatGPT could take action on a repository,
                  e.g. opening a pull request. You can view the Windsurf
                  acquisition as accelerating the roadmap of which this feature
                  is a part.

              <p>
                I thought this chart would skew towards startup data
                (self-selection of Ramp's customer base), but Ramp's data
                actually suggests larger companies are adopting AI faster than
                startups (as a % of companies):

                Enterprise revenue would help OpenAI differentiate its business
                away from notoriously fickle consumer subscribers. Today, most
                of OpenAI's revenue comes from a consumer subscription product,
                ChatGPT. How durable is this revenue, given that (a) models are
                commoditizing, (b) free substitutes are cropping up from
                competitors large (Google, Meta) and small (Perplexity,
                <a

                  >Chorus</a
                >), and (c) consumers churn at a relatively high rate?
              </p>
              <p>
                Faced with this question, a rational strategy would be to pursue
                enterprise revenue, which by contrast is quite sticky. Doing so
                would give OpenAI an effective hedge in case threats to their
                consumer business materialize.

                  tier is currently a loss leader, driving revenue to their Plus
                  and Pro businesses. Not only is there a significant revenue
                  opportunity on the free tier (monetization follows attention),
                  but an ad business is also an effective hedge against
                  challenges to their consumer subscription product.

              <p>What does all this mean for Cursor?</p>

              <p>
                Cursor reportedly turned down an acquisition offer from OpenAI
                last year. I thought

                had a good game-theoretical analysis (around 3:57):
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                When you're the number two and you get the heavy squeeze from
                the adjacent acquirer, it often makes sense to fold, because
                otherwise they might buy the number one and then you're done.
                When you are the number one, you might be able to stay yourself,
                I'm still the independent winner, I can create value, there are
                other acquirers. [Cursor] is probably bravely going forward
                saying, "This is the bet we're taking." But yeah, it takes real
                courage to turn down whatever was offered and say we're going to
                compete against these guys instead.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                I'm a happy DAU of Cursor. If OpenAI offered the same product
                somehow built into ChatGPT and bundled with my Plus
                subscription, would I switch away from Cursor? Maybe – if:

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  ChatGPT offers a similar familiar IDE experience – Windsurf
                  brings that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are compelling features such as integrations to Vercel
                  and Stripe – they've already got Github.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cursor doesn't introduce new compelling features to head that
                  off in the meantime – this is the question.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This is the $9B question, in fact, as Cursor just last week
                raised $900M at that valuation (<a
