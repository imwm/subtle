                <a href="https://lovable.dev/" class="underline hover:opacity-75" target="_blank">Lovable</a> is reportedly the
                fastest growing startup in the world, so I figured I'd give it a
                shot.
              </p>

              <p>
                I've been helping a friend get a film-related mobile app off the
                ground, so I decided to use Lovable to make a high-fidelity,
                interactive prototype. I described the app in some detail to
                ChatGPT and asked it for a concise prompt for Lovable, which it
                gave me. I plugged it into Lovable, along with a screenshot of a
                mockup to illustrate the aesthetic.
              </p>

              <p>
                The result was pretty good. The aesthetic was matched very
                closely, the basic navigation was there, and the sample data was
                rich. There were a couple issues about content not being inside
                the right container, and the bottom tab bar was inconsistent
                from screen to screen. These were improved but not totally fixed
                after a couple followup instructions.
              </p>

              <p>
                What I was surprised by was Lovable's extremely aggressive
                paywall. On the free tier you get five prompts a day. You
                quickly run into this because Lovable makes basic mistakes when
                implementing code (see examples above).
              </p>

              <p>
                There's actually a perverse incentive at play: if Lovable became
                excellent at one-shotting users' app concepts, fewer people
                would hit the usage limits, reducing the growth of their paid
                tier. I wonder how this is playing out internally...
              </p>

              <p>
                The need to reprompt Lovable plus its stingy paywall helped me
                understand why it's growing so fast. Text-to-product experiences
                are magical, to be sure, and I imagine Lovable's word of mouth
                is reasonably strong. But now I better understand why they've
                been so effective at creating an
                <a href="https://x.com/antonosika/status/1899572640966447549" class="underline hover:opacity-75" target="_blank"
                  >exponential revenue growth chart</a
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                I imagine Lovable users churn often. It's fun to describe an app
                and then see it exist, but how many of these apps are
                production-ready, or even apps people intend to deploy? Vercel
                tracks
                <a href="https://x.com/rauchg/status/1917369030106832897" class="underline hover:opacity-75" target="_blank"
                  ># of deployments</a
                >. I wonder how many of Lovable's projects are deployed.

                On 20VC, angel investor Fabrice Grinda was asked about whether
                he worries about missing out on certain hyperscaling AI startups
                such as Lovable.

                What worries me about the gold rush is there are too many
                companies doing the exact same thing going after the exact same
                category, and it's unclear who's going to win.... What worries
                me about the Lovable-type examples is, yeah, they can go from $0
                to $18M in ARR in like three months, but you can go back in the
                other direction.<br /><br />I don't know if people remember that
                AI company where everyone for a month basically changed their
                profile photo using AI â€“ the name might come back to me. And
                their MRR went from $250k a month to $30M, and 99% churn a month
                later they're back to $500k. And they raised at that moment in
                time. So these things are riskier than people think they are.<br /><br />
                Do I think that Github... can launch coding tools to compete
                with the likes of Lovable and Cursor? Yes, absolutely. I don't
                mind missing the bubbly elements of the bubble. I worry that
                people are underestimating the orthogonal risk from either
                OpenAI extending their stack... I feel people are
                underestimating the risk of zeroes even though something can go
                from $0 to $100M in ARR very quickly.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                The way that I could see Lovable succeeding is by becoming the
                prototyping platform of choice for product people (PMs,
                designers) and agencies.
              </p>

              <p>
                The latter is particularly interesting, because there's about to
                be tremendous downward pricing pressure on agencies as everyone
                catches on to the utility of tools like Cursor and Lovable.
              </p>

                recently launched and it was all about collaboration. I can see
                Lovable being the platform on which people collaborate on
                prototypes. Think about this in the agency context: instead of
                presenting a bunch of slides to a client, hearing feedback,
                iterating, and then presenting again, you can just pull up a
                prototype and live update it together in a single session.
              </p>

              <p>
                I did, however, hear from a designer friend that v0 is better than Lovable. I
                haven't tried it yet, but I already pay for Vercel, so v0 might
                become my prototyping tool of choice.
              </p>

              <p>
                But yeah, I'm somewhat bearish on Lovable after my experience with
                them, even though they may be the fastest growing startup in the
                world.
