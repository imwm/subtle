                Azeem Azhar recently summarized the before/after of commoditized
                intelligence (<a
                  href="https://archive.is/dsMyG"
                  target="_blank"

              </p>
              <blockquote>
                For most of history, hiring a dozen PhDs meant a massive budget
                and months of lead time. Today, a few keystrokes in a chatbot
                summon that brainpower in seconds.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In light of this sudden appearance of free intelligence, Azhar
                continues, there's an important question:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                The question facing individuals and organizations alike is: What
                will you do when intelligence itself is suddenly ubiquitous and
                practically free?
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The way I think about this is that the traditional company is
                being unbundled.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can think of company personnel as agglomerations of
                intelligence, domain expertise, and productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Historically, it was much more efficient for people to hire
                people full-time than to contract out every task big or small.
                Economist Ronald Coase won the Nobel prize in part for proving
                this.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, that fundamental premise of company formation no longer
                holds.
              </p>
              <p>
                As Azhar mentioned, PhD level expertise in virtually any domain
                is now available on-demand.
              </p>
              <p>
                The high cumulative transaction costs of contracting people for
                any and every task are now dropping to zero.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is why we believe inspired, resourceful individuals will
                increasingly outperform teams.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can think of the "company" of the future as a solo operator
                working with a team of ephemeral "coworkers."
              </p>
              <p>
                Each ephemeral coworker is spun up tailor-made for the task at
                hand, with the right expertise, the right context, and the right
                incentives.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this structure, the solo operator should be able to
                outperform traditional companies, because their overhead is
                vastly lower and their performance may actually be better.
