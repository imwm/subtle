                I've been a DAU of Cursor since last March and continue to be.
                Claude Code is very hyped. After trying it out, I think the
                appeal of Claude Code comes down to these four factors:
              </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Opus 4.5 is an insanely good model for coding and knowledge
                  work generally.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Claude's pricing is relatively generous. Precise token limits
                  by plan are hard to determine, but if you use hundreds of
                  millions of Opus 4.5 tokens per month, the Claude Max 20x plan
                  is the cheapest way to consume them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The terminal UI makes you feel like a 1337 h4x0r, even though
                  it's essentially a chat interface. This is an underrated
                  aspect of the appeal and buzz in my opinion (see
                  <a
                    href="https://x.com/jarrodwatts/status/2008304491750359150"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    >this tweet</a
                  >).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Claude skills and plugins are apparently useful though I admit
                  I haven't perused those libraries yet.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I've been using Cursor as my daily driver for almost a year now,
                and I don't plan to switch to Claude Code, at least not yet.
                Here's my thinking, starting by addressing the above reasons one
                by one:
              </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Opus 4.5:</strong> You can use it in Cursor.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Price:</strong> This is the best reason to switch from
                  Cursor to Claude Code. I'm at about 700M Opus 4.5 tokens
                  consumed in my current billing period. Google AI Mode
                  estimates I'd save $200-400 per month. That's a real point in
                  favor of switching to Claude Code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Terminal UI:</strong> Doesn't matter to me. If it did,
                  <a
                    href="https://cursor.com/cli"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    >Cursor CLI</a
                  >
                  exists now too.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Claude Skills:</strong> You can now
                  <a
                    href="https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    >use them in Cursor</a
                  >.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                So price is really the main reason I'd switch. But Cursor has a
                number of advantages to me over Claude Code.
              </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>IDE interface:</strong> I tend to make changes to
                  front-end files because I have opinions (right or wrong) about
                  details of the UI. I also like being able to review files in a
                  familiar IDE environment to see what's going on or look at
                  diffs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Model-agnosticism:</strong> Cursor gives you access to
                  Anthropic's models (Opus 4.5 is the main one I use these
                  days), but also everyone else's models. I use Composer-1 for
                  straightforward implementation tasks because it's usually
                  faster. I'm interested in trying out Codex-5.2 because
                  apparently it's the best at debugging. New powerful models
                  come out from different companies every few months – I like
                  the model optionality that Cursor provides.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bugbot:</strong> I'm a huge fan of bugbot, which has
                  saved me on numerous occasions. It now has an "autofix" mode,
                  which can commit fixes directly to a branch after identifying
                  them. So good.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Switching cost:</strong> I've already configured
                  Cursor. I've set up integrations, MCP connections, rules,
                  extensions... Yes, I can set all this stuff up in Claude Code,
                  and yes it's pure laziness to not want to do so, but I still
                  don't want to do it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cloud agents:</strong> These exist in Claude Code too,
                  I think, but I like being able to kick off a Cursor cloud
                  agent from Linear or from my phone and get a good PR.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I'm probably paying a few hundred dollars every month for these
                benefits of Cursor over Claude Code. But to me it's worth it.
