                ChatGPT announced a new version of its "memory" feature today:

                <li>
                  Previously, ChatGPT occasionally noticed when it should
                  remember something about the user, such as what their job is
                  or where they live.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Now, ChatGPT will draw from the user's entire chat history,
                  not just from the intentionally remembered fact base.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                (I haven't noticed more relevant responses in the product yet â€“
                but let's assume they've achieved what their tweet claims.)
              </p>

              <p>
                We've discussed
                <a
                  href="/what-is-good-ai-revenue"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >switching costs for AI products before</a
                >, and
                <a
                  href="/chatgpt-messaging-play"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >for ChatGPT in particular</a
                >. This change is a major step toward lock-in for ChatGPT users.
              </p>

              <p>
                Switching costs often emerge from adding a lot of data to a
                product. An example in the consumer context is Spotify: the more
                you use Spotify, the more it learns your musical taste, the
                better its recommendations are. The cost of switching to a
                different streaming service would be resetting the quality of
                music recommendations to essentially zero.
              </p>

              <p>
                Similarly with ChatGPT's new approach to memory, the more you
                interact with ChatGPT, theoretically the better interactions
                get. Switching to Claude or Gemini would reset that
                personalization. (I imagine ChatGPT is not going out of their
                way to make it easy to port your chat history to another
                service.)
              </p>

              <p>
                But this is even more intense of a switching cost in the
                enterprise context. If you've been using ChatGPT for work, your
                chat history will be filled with valuable business data and
                context, which will make future answers much more valuable.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is also why AI products like
                <a
                  href="/is-cursor-a-good-business"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >Cursor</a
                >
                actually do have switching costs (despite what Sam Lessin said
                recently).
              </p>

              <p>
                A friend recently pointed out that Cursor works much better with
                <a
                  href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >rule files</a
                >, which in a business context can enforce style guides, coding
                standards, test procedures, and more. Building out and
                maintaining the rulefile creates a meaningful switching cost,
                akin to the ChatGPT chat history.
