              <p>
                Tools like Cursor and Lovable are making it way easier to build
                software. Software agencies will not be able to justify their
                previous prices and timelines in this new world.
              </p>

              <p>
                Previously, software agencies could quote six figures for 3-6
                months of work on a marketing website or minimum viable product.
                They calculated those prices by making a cushioned estimate,
                pro-rating the market salaries of a designer and a couple
                engineers, and adding a 20-40% margin.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, a solo developer can build the same product in a matter of
                weeks â€“ or even days. Solo developers with good stakeholder
                management skills will use tools like Lovable to collaborate
                directly with clients on prototypes. This should make the
                overall experience better for both parties and improve the end
                product.
              </p>

              <p>
                In fact, I'm going to test this hypothesis myself. If you're
                interested in building a good product fast and cheap,
                <a href="mailto:hi@subtle.so" class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >reach out</a
                >.
              </p>

              <p>
                For legacy software agencies, there's an arb opportunity right
                now to continue to quote legacy prices and timelines while
                adopting new AI tools internally. I wonder how widespread this
                is, and how long it will last.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the future, not all software agencies might suffer. In fact,
                in a world with way more software, it's harder to stand out, so
                the demand for the best agencies may increase.
              </p>

              <p>
                But for the median agency, I don't see how the legacy terms are
                sustainable.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm not the first person to realize this. Here are a couple
                examples:
                <a
                  href="https://tessellatelabs.com/"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Tessellate Labs</a
                >
                and
                <a
                  href="https://lovablemvp.scalarbit.com/"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >LovableMVP</a
                >
                (can't vouch for quality).
              </p>

              <p>
                I'll post case studies, with client permission, on this site in
                the future.
