              <p>
                The title is slightly provocative, but I wanted to collect a few
                observations about the psychology of discovering and adopting
                new products in this new age of software development.
              </p>

              <p>
                If I think about the tools I've personally adopted as daily
                workhorses – ChatGPT, Cursor, Devin – I was not convinced to try
                them by a landing page. I was convinced to try them by strong
                word of mouth. The landing page for these products was
                essentially a formality, one whose principal job was to give me
                access to the product I already wanted to try.
              </p>

              <p>
                I've noticed something similar with other breakthrough AI
                products: Lovable, Bolt, Replit, Boardy... To drive adoption,
                the message via word of mouth can't just be "I like this
                product," but instead, "You have to try it." That magic first
                experience yields growth.
              </p>

              <p>
                Driving word of mouth that specifically says "You have to try
                it" will be increasingly important for a couple reasons:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  First, the supply of software is growing dramatically. There's
                  seemingly a hot new AI tool every day. Most people don't want
                  to try new software daily, or even weekly. Our bar for trying
                  new software is going up.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Second, vibe coding a landing page is easier than ever. In
                  fact, text-to-product tools like Lovable and Bolt excel at
                  creating landing pages, while they're less good at creating
                  production-grade applications. I think we'll see an explosion
                  of landing pages with similar designs, selling similar
                  products with similar taglines (e.g.
                  <a
                    href="deckspeed.com"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    target="_blank"
                    >"Cursor for slides"</a
                  >
                  from the top of Product Hunt). These landing pages
                  increasingly won't sell, and the sale will instead need to
                  happen upstream (esp. through word of mouth).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                There are some exceptions to this. Enterprise software adoption
                is less driven by word of mouth and more driven by marketing /
                targeted outbound to executives. Enterprise software landing
                pages may remain important because, for example, they can cover
                lots of the questions enterprise buyers ask of their software
                and convert warm leads.
              </p>

              <p>
                But increasingly for most software adoption, the key will be
                creating a magical product experience that drives your users to
                say, "You have to try it."
