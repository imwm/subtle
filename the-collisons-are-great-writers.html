                The main point I wanted to discuss is their defense of LLM
                wrappers. But I couldn't help but admire the writing abilities
                of co-founders Patrick and John Collison:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                For too long the crypto economy was an isolated atoll, with
                vibrant native customs but few exports to the rest of the world.
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                Why care about stablecoins? Improvements to the basic usability
                of money make economies more prosperous. Consider the
                transitions from coins to banknotes, from the gold standard to
                fiat currency, and from paper instruments to electronic
                payments. Stablecoins are a new branch of the money tree.
              </blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                GDPR alone is estimated to have reduced profits for small tech
                firms in Europe by up to 12%. Those cookie banners hurt, whether
                you accept them or not.

              <p>They can even make credit card fraud sound interesting.</p>
              <blockquote>
                Fraudulent actors today operate on an industrial scale, with
                teams of engineers, managers, and data analysts. (We are yet to
                verify whether they have HR departments. If you know, please
                tell us so we can give them some peer feedback.) Fraudulent
                actors generally target times when fraud teams are offline—we
                see more fraud on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays—but we see
                subtler patterns, too, like the fraudsters' own work schedules.
                Fraudsters are particular about their lunch breaks.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Clearly the Collisons write without LLMs. They raw dog the page
                like Mark Twain. I would buy an ETF of well-written annual
                reports by CEOs. The Collisons, Bezos, and Buffet all have this
                in common.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyhow, the main point is addressing the Collisons' defense of
                so-called "LLM wrappers." These are applications whose main
                capability stems from the LLM that powers it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jasper was an early example of an LLM wrapper. Jasper's whole
                appeal stemmed from its use of language models, and not from any
                proprietary technology, underlying dataset, or breakthrough
                capability. Jasper is probably now in trouble and I would bet it
                gets sold for parts in the near future.
              </p>
              <p>Here's what the Collisons say:</p>
              <blockquote>
                Much as SaaS started horizontal and then went vertical (first
                Salesforce and then Toast), we're seeing a similar dynamic
                playing out in AI: we started with ChatGPT, but are now seeing a
                proliferation of industry specific tools. Some people have
                called these startups "LLM wrappers"; those people are missing
                the point. The O ring model in economics shows that in a process
                with interdependent tasks, the overall output or productivity is
                limited by the least effective component, not just in terms of
                cost but in the success of the entire system. In a similar vein,
                we see these new industry specific AI tools as ensuring that
                individual industries can properly realize the economic impact
                of LLMs, and that the contextual, data, and workflow integration
                will prove enduringly valuable.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                AI applications may verticalize as SaaS apps did. There's reason
                to think, however, that the pattern won't apply again. (These
                are rough thoughts so feel free to

                Software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications were made possible by
                cloud computing:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Before, people had to buy software CDs, install software on
                  their computers, and connect to on-premise databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After, people could access software over the internet, and
                  connect to cloud databases.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This change made it a lot easier for people to develop, deploy,
                and distribute software, leading to a huge increase in the
                supply of software, including lots of specialty (i.e. vertical)
                apps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite this, there were two significant constraints on SaaS
                products that left vertical opportunities available:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <b>Development cost:</b> It cost a lot of money and time to
                  build out secure, reliable, and usable software. Building just
                  the Salesforce app has cost them hundreds of millions of
                  dollars if not billions over many years. They had to focus on
                  their core product to be successful.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>User expectations:</b> Salesforce's app was used by a lot
                  of people every day. There had to be basic consistency to the
                  product experience over time, otherwise users would be
                  confused and switch to something else.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Both of these constraints go away with AI applications:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Development costs are going to zero with tools like Cursor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  User expectations won't matter because agents will be doing
                  the work on people's behalf.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Taken together, this means that LLM-powered agents from
                companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more may not leave
                as many vertical opportunities as SaaS horizontal winners did.
