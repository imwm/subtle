                I set up a new pricing scheme for a data platform launching
                within days (more soon). Pricing is a

                  >particular interest of mine</a
                >. I was thinking about what prices to list on the landing page.
                I considered doing a price that ended in a nine because lots of
                companies do that and it may improve conversion rates. But I
                decided against it in favor of round prices. Here's my thinking.

                The product experience isn't just the software experience. It's
                every interaction with your company: the URL, the name, how you
                heard about it, what the landing page looks like, what the
                prices are – everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a customer, seeing a clean $10 price tag on a product makes
                me feel treated better than seeing $9.99. The latter whiffs of
                manipulation, exploiting a psychological hack to increase
                conversion. Companies that show clean product prices win brand
                points with me.

                Linear is one of the most beloved products in software
                development today. They offer simple, clean prices on their

                Cursor is also a beloved product, but their rollout of new
                pricing in the spring was opaque and arguably exploitative. A
                backlash ensued. Cursor apologized, but it may have cost them
                market share to Claude Code, Codex, and GitHub Copilot.

                As a side note, I recently learned that the 99¢ price strategy
                didn't emerge as a conversion hack, but instead as a way to
                prevent employee embezzlement, beginning in the late 19th
                century. From

              <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-600 pl-4">
                Every time a clerk rang up a sale, the drawer opened and the
                bell chimed. That sound told the owner money was (or wasn't)
                going into the till. Merchants discovered that if they priced
                items at 49¢ or 99¢, the clerk had to open the drawer to make
                change, forcing the bell to ring and the sale to be recorded.
                Around this time in the late 1800s, prices began ending this
                way.

                Marketing psychology caught onto the price perception benefits
                of the 99¢ strategy decades later.
