                Replit recently announced a set of features meant to help their
                users generate applications that don't have common security
                vulnerabilities:

                The two things they added that will probably help are Auth and
                "Security."
              </p>

              <p>
                Auth is pretty straightforward: in addition to various built-in
                cloud services like hosting, databases, and analytics, Replit
                now offers authentication. This not only saves users time (auth
                can be surprisingly tricky), but also reduces the likelihood of
                an insecure authentication implementation.
              </p>

              <p>"Security" is a bundle of things:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>The agent now won't modify any important config files.</li>
                <li>
                  There will be security warnings around things like pasting API
                  keys into the agent chat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A new feature called Security Scan will look through the
                  codebase and surface any common security issues.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Security Scan is the key thing. Vibe coders aren't cybersecurity
                experts, and they shouldn't have to be. Replit stands in as
                their security expert.
              </p>

              <p>
                Replit is in an interesting position with respect to their
                competitors in code generation such as Lovable and Cursor.
                Actually there's a kind of spectrum between Lovable and Cursor
                on which Replit falls in the middle:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Lovable: No IDE, just a text-to-code agent. The developer
                  experience is almost fully abstracted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Replit: Web-based IDE with text-to-code and embedded cloud
                  services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cursor: Traditional IDE with agent and autocomplete
                  capabilities.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                While Cursor's revenue growth has been remarkable, I have
                <a

                  >some questions</a
                >
                about Lovable's durability.
              </p>

              <p>
                Replit, though, could end up being the winner. With their
                foundation of a web-based IDE and embedded cloud services, they
                could end up combining the best of both ends of this spectrum.
                That is, an abstracted developer experience for vibe coders that
                offers all the things you need to power a great app – including,
                now, automated security review.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reportedly, Replit's revenue has accelerated significantly since
                they introduced the agent feature:

                I could see this trend continuing for the foreseeable future.
                The only thing is Replit doesn't seem to have as much virality
                and word of mouth as its competitors. Not sure why that is. If I
                were running Replit I would prioritize cracking that. (<a
