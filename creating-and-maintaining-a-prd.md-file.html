                I've previously written about the utility of having a
                <a href="/prd-md" class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  ><code>prd.md</code></a
                >
                in your project repo. It solves the problem of new chats with
                code agents starting with zero context.

              <p>
                Here are some other tips on creating and utilizing this file.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-bold">Creating a prd.md file</h2>
              <p>
                When I'm starting a new project, I typically converse with a
                reasoning model, such as o3 or Gemini 2.5. I start with the
                general idea and problem I'm trying to solve. The conversation
                then mainly consists of discussion of various approaches and
                homing in on a plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the plan is set, I ask the reasoning model to generate a
                <code>prd.md</code> file that I can then use to initialize the
                project. Specifically, the file should include relevant details
                for a coding agent to best execute our plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also generate a <code>prd.md</code> file retroactively,
                after the project is started. In fact, I just generated one for
                this website. The following prompt was effective:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                can you review this codebase, which is a static website that is
                a personal blog (subtle.so) built using html, css, and vanilla
                js, and create a prd.md file that provides a general overview,
                context, and some design principles for future coding agents who
                might work on this codebase? it doesn't have to be super
                verbose, maybe just like 4-5 sections with information useful to
                LLMs.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                I've found that Gemini 2.5 excels at repo-wide context. I used
                it for this prompt and you can see the results
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/imwm/subtle/blob/main/prd.md"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"

                >.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-bold">Maintaining a prd.md file</h2>
              <p>
                As you work on your project and make changes or add features,
                you should update the <code>prd.md</code> file to reflect the
                current state of the project. This ensures that the file remains
                relevant and useful to future coding agents.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've found the easiest way to do this is to ask a reasoning
                model to update the file at the end of a coding session. For
                this, I typically pose the following to Gemini 2.5:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                can you review the codebase functionality and compare it to the
                current <code>prd.md</code> file, and for any significant
                details from the codebase that are missing from the
                <code>prd.md</code> file, update that file accordingly? think
                about context and details that would matter most to coding
                agents who might work on this project in the future.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                (I've stopped saying "please" and "thank you" to these models
                because apparently that wastes energy ðŸ˜¬)
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm trying some new agentic products such as
                <a
                  href="https://devin.ai"
                  target="_blank"

                  >Devin</a
                >
                and
                <a
                  href="https://www.spurtest.com/"
                  target="_blank"

                  >Spur</a
                >, which will probably work better when they have access to a
                context file like <code>prd.md</code>.
