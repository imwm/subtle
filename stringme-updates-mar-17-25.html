                Today Stripe added the ability to copy the text of their docs or
                view the page as markdown:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark">

                  We've added /llms.txt and Markdown to

                This is an example of a company proactively making the contents
                of their webpages more readily available for LLMs.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, this is one of over 50 billion webpages. There's a
                tragedy of the commons problem â€“ most webpages won't make
                /llms.txt or equivalent available anytime soon.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the meantime, that's what stringme.dev is for. Just prepend
                stringme.dev to any URL and get a relatively clean,
                LLM-optimized plain text response. At least that's the dream.
              </p>
              <p>
                At one point during development, I used stringme.dev to generate
                a quick plain text version of
                <a
                  href="https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-files-in-serverless-functions"
                  class="article-link"
                  >Vercel docs</a
                >
                to paste it into the Cursor agent. It worked pretty well!
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are a few updates I've made â€“ though I'm currently battling
                Vercel functions to get those working properly in production:
              </p>
              <ul class="article-list">
                <li>
                  Incorporated Firecrawl as a better way to scrape webpages and
                  get the HTML.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Passing that scraped HTML to Mozilla's Readability.js to
                  isolate the main content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Passing the main content to Open (GPT-4o-mini, for now) to get
                  a good summary and list of key facts. I wanted to do this
                  without using an LLM, but I caved.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The next steps are to:</p>
              <ul class="article-list">
                <li>
                  Fix Vercel functions (they're harder to deal with than I
                  thought) or deploy the back-end to something like Fly.io.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implement caching â€“ ideally through Vercel's edge network, but
                  the experience with functions limits our optimism about that.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improve scraping against certain websites that have intense
                  anti-scraping measures.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                And as a behind the scenes note: I write these posts in Cursor,
                all lowercase and kind of a ramble. Then when I'm done I use
                cmd+K to apply the following edit:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                can you punctuate this properly, wrap each line in a &lt;p&gt;
                tag, and make it slightly more readble
              </blockquote>
