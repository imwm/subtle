                A little newsletter called
                <a
                  href="https://flowstate.fm"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >flowstate.fm</a
                >
                asked us for help with their sponsorship business.
              </p>
              <p>
                They wanted to make a website where people could book weekly
                sponsorships directly. They also wanted some help with outbound
                lead generation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The result is
                <a
                  href="https://sponsor.flowstate.fm"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >sponsor.flowstate.fm</a
                >
                which we built in just a few hours. Here's how we did it:
              </p>
              <p>Cursor agent (chef's kiss):</p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  Used Claude 3.7, which is excellent at understanding the
                  entire codebase, finding existing patterns, and applying them.
                  It also seems to have better design sense than 3.5 (based on
                  my experience using 3.5 with Replit).
                </li>
                <li>
                  I was pressing "accept all" frequently, but then turned on
                  "yolo mode" and only had to undo things about 3 times.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The only time it got stuck was on weird errors. One happened
                  when I was on Tailwind 4 and it couldn't understand that
                  PostCSS was a different package. Another occurred when Vercel
                  was inexplicably not installing its own analytics package
                  (Cursor tried switching from TS to JS and directly importing –
                  good attempts, but it should have taken a step back and done a
                  reinstall rather than working around Vercel's weird problem).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Eventually I reached the point where I wasn't using the IDE at
                  all, just the agent and the terminal (mostly for git
                  commands).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Other services we used:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Stripe: No brainer.</li>
                <li>
                  Supabase: Shout out to Rick for recommending this. It's very
                  nice and easy to use. Cursor knows how to use it too.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vercel: Cursor wanted to do a NextJS app and then deploy it on
                  Vercel. I hadn't used Vercel before, but it was super easy:
                  login with GitHub, pick the repo, hit deploy, fix a few build
                  errors that Cursor identified, and then deploy. It
                  auto-redeploys whenever `main` is updated.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                With
                <a
                  href="https://sponsor.flowstate.fm"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >sponsor.flowstate.fm</a
                >
                set up and taking bookings, we needed to generate leads. Here's
                how we did that:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  We asked ChatGPT where to find leads. It offered several
                  suggestions, including using
                  <a
                    href="https://hunter.io"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    target="_blank"
                    >hunter.io</a
                  >
                  for finding emails.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We signed up for
                  <a
                    href="https://hunter.io"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                    target="_blank"
                    >hunter.io</a
                  >, which let us (a) pick an industry, (b) pick companies, (c)
                  pick departments (marketing), and (d) find emails. From about
                  50 companies, we gathered 500 email addresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We downloaded the CSV of 500 contacts with metadata (company,
                  name, location), added columns for subject line and email
                  body, and wrote those for the first contact.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We uploaded the CSV to ChatGPT and asked GPT-4.5 to fill in
                  the remaining subject lines and email bodies based on the
                  first one. It completed this in about 5 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  From the 500 contacts and emails, we selected 50 to start with
                  – maximum one per company, prioritizing the most senior
                  marketing person. We've sent those out and hopefully we get at
                  least one booking!
