                I took a couple weeks while traveling to reflect on Subtle so
                far. Here are the reflections and changes going forward.
              </p>

              <p><b>1. Cadence will be 2-3 posts per week</b></p>
              <p>
                Since early March I've been posting daily. That was a helpful
                forcing function to make progress daily in the beginning. But
                some days it resulted in a rushed post or simple aggregation. I
                probably won't have something significant to post more than two
                or three times per week.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, looking at the analytics (shout out
                <a
                  href="https://plausible.io"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >plausible.io</a
                >), there's been a power law in the readership of posts. Of the
                47 posts I've published so far, only three have gotten more than
                100 views. Those top three posts are:

              <p>
                There are diminishing returns to posting more. By posting a
                couple of times per week, I'll take bigger swings and give
                myself more time to make progress on original products. Which
                leads me to...
              </p>

              <p><b>2. Posts will focus more on original products</b></p>
              <p>
                Most posts so far have offered commentary on LLM products. These
                were fun to write, especially as I immersed myself more in these
                tools which are truly changing knowledge work.
              </p>
              <p>
                But
                <a
                  href="every-knows-whats-up.html"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >as the company Every observed</a
                >, the best way to build credibility is to build original
                products. I'll be spending more of my time using the tools I'm
                now familiar with (esp. Cursor) to ship more products, explain
                the rationale behind them, and share learnings from the build
                process.
              </p>

              <p>
                So expect more of an editorial focus on what I'm building rather
                than what's happening in the industry.
              </p>

              <p><b>3. Subtle Software & Subtle Services</b></p>
              <p>
                To make it clear that this website is about software, I've
                updated the website title to be Subtle Software.
              </p>

              <p>
                There's also now a services offering (more
                <a href="services.html" class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >here</a
                >). I didn't set out to offer consulting or agency services.
                They spontaneously appeared to me in a compelling manner:
                introductions via my network to great people working on
                interesting missions and cool products.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'll be spending part of my time advising/coaching startups
                mainly on product management. I'll also be testing my hypothesis
                that the work of software agencies / dev shops can be achieved
                10x cheaper and faster by a motivated, resourceful individual
                (namely, me).
              </p>

              <p>
                I'll also occasionally post here about certain concepts that
                recur in my services engagements (while respecting
                confidentiality).
