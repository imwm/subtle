              Vibe coding is not without risks and may lead to lost work and
              security vulnerabilities. Here are some pointers for how to vibe

              That said, there's also a new security opportunity in the world of

              Today Stripe added the ability to copy the text of their docs or
              view the page as markdown. This is an example of a company
              proactively making the contents of their webpages more readily
              available for LLMs.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this is one of over 50 billion webpages. There's a
              tragedy of the commons problem: most webpages won't make /llms.txt
              or equivalent available anytime soon. In the meantime, that's what
              stringme.dev is for...

            <p>
              The main lesson from building stringme.dev was to identify the
              languages, frameworks, and services you'll need up front when vibe
              coding.

              We ran into problems when we told Cursor mid-project that we
              wanted to use Tailwind, deploy via Vercel, or switch from
              TypeScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>

              Added quick URL buttons for example websites, improved copy across
              the site, and implemented Mozilla's readability library to strip
              away extraneous filler text from webpages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also improved text optimization for LLMs while stubbornly refusing
              to use an LLM for this process itself.

              This service takes a URL and generates a text string. Sounds
              simple. Why does it matter?
            </p>
            <p>
              I got the idea from an Andrej Karpathy tweet about needing a
              service that takes a URL and returns clean text content for LLMs.

            <blockquote>
              Once I've completed the initial research I change modes
              dramatically. For production code my LLM usage is much more
              authoritarian: I treat it like a digital intern, hired to type
              code for me based on my detailed instructions.

              It's similar to OpenAI's Operator product, in that it's an agent
              that can be assigned a complex task and then autonomously,
              iteratively complete it.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
              For too long the crypto economy was an isolated atoll, with
              vibrant native customs but few exports to the rest of the world.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Clearly the Collisons write without LLMs. They raw dog the page
              like Mark Twain...

              They wanted to make a website where people could book weekly
              sponsorships directly. They also wanted some help with outbound
              lead generation.

              Azeem Azhar recently summarized the before/after of commoditized
              intelligence (<a href="https://archive.is/dsMyG" target="_blank"

              For most of history, hiring a dozen PhDs meant a massive budget
              and months of lead time. Today, a few keystrokes in a chatbot
              summon that brainpower in seconds.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In light of this sudden appearance of free intelligence, Azhar
              continues, there's an important question:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              The question facing individuals and organizations alike is: What
              will you do when intelligence itself is suddenly ubiquitous and
              practically free?

              The way I think about this is that the traditional company is
              being unbundled...

              When you're working for a company, your compensation is typically
              a salary and maybe a bonus and/or stock options.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the perspective of naked self-interest, an employee in this
              position should optimize their performance for the arbiters of
              this compensation, namely the managers who run performance
              reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes there is alignment between doing great work and the
              perspectives of company managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              But often, companies develop many competing considerations and
              internal prerogatives that cloud managers' judgment when it comes
              to great work.
            </p>
            <p>
              In one person teams, however, the only priority is customer
              service. Compensation in one person teams is exactly company
              revenue, and that revenue is entirely determined by customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus in one person teams, compensation is set by customers, rather
              than managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The solo team structure offers a purer reward function for
              builders.
