                Simon, who created the popular Python framework

                now.

              <p>
                The context available to the LLM is a major factor in its
                effectiveness. A product design corollary to this is that LLM
                context should be accessible to the user.

                One of the reasons I mostly work directly with the ChatGPT and
                Claude web or app interfaces is that it makes it easier for me
                to understand exactly what is going into the context. LLM tools
                that obscure that context from me are less effective.

              <p>
                Cursor, the code editor I use, automatically includes the entire
                existing repo in its context. I've found that Cursor's agent,
                using <strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong>, can navigate the repo
                and find relevant context for a given task. Also, Cursor
                apparently trained its own powerful embeddings model (<a

              <p>LLMs are especially useful in the research phase:</p>
              <blockquote>
                Most of my projects start with some open questions: is the thing
                I'm trying to do possible? What are the potential ways I could
                implement it? Which of those options are the best? I use LLMs as
                part of this initial research phase.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                I tend to use ChatGPT o1 for this. I ask a question like, "I'm
                looking to build a software application that does X, Y, Z. Can
                you suggest a few approaches to building this, ideally ranging
                from extremely simple to complex?"
              </p>
              <p>
                I may also include parameters such as "I'd like to use Node and
                React for this" or "Let's use Supabase for this project."
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you've identified your approach, then you micro-manage the
                LLM:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                Once I've completed the initial research I change modes
                dramatically. For production code my LLM usage is much more
                authoritarian: I treat it like a digital intern, hired to type
                code for me based on my detailed instructions.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                I've found Cursor's agent to be very good at handling open-ended
                prompts like "Add a list of weeks that the user can multi-select
                to book one or more sponsorships and include a checkout flow."
                What I tend to have to be specific about is design details, such
                as "A fixed footer should reflect the current spending total,
                with the dollar tally on the left side and a primary color
                'Proceed to Checkout' button on the right."
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                If I don't like what an LLM has written, they'll never complain
                at being told to refactor it! "Break that repetitive code out
                into a function", "use string manipulation methods rather than a
                regular expression", or even "write that better!"â€”the code an
                LLM produces first time is rarely the final implementation, but
                they can re-type it dozens of times for you without ever getting
                frustrated or bored.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In my experience there's a bit of a learning curve to this. You
                get really impressed by the work that products like Cursor agent
                and ChatGPT do very quickly, and there's a temptation to adopt a
                mental model that you're talking to a highly capable software
                engineer. So then when a mistake is made or the agent is going
                down the wrong path, you want to gently give it constructive
                feedback to change course or rollback. You sort of brace for a
                difficult conversation but the immediate reply that appears is
                chipper, almost like it's excited that there's more work to do.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                The best way to learn LLMs is to play with them. Throwing absurd
                ideas at them and vibe-coding until they almost sort-of work is
                a genuinely useful way to accelerate the rate at which you build
                intuition for what works and what doesn't.

                Something I didn't know about until reading this piece is Simon
                has an open source repo of over 80 mini apps ("tools") that he's
                built using LLMs. Check it out on Github
                <a

                individuals now have because of LLMs.
