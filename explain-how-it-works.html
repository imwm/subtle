              <p>
                Typically, when I write a blog post here about a new product, I
                go into detail on how the product works. Examples include
                <a href="/agentic-equities" class="text-accent hover:underline"
                  >Agentic Equities</a
                >
                and
                <a href="/distilljs" class="text-accent hover:underline"
                  >DistillJS</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                At various points, I've received advice not to share that level
                of detail because people could copy the project. I haven't
                followed this advice for a few reasons:
              </p>
              <p>
                First, these are the blog posts I would want to read. If I'm
                intrigued by a new product, I want to know how it works. My
                approach is to write the post I'd want to read.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, I'd like for a product of mine to be successful not
                because its inner workings were kept secret, but because it
                solved a real problem and developed a genuine moat. Just as
                "security through obscurity" is not worth relying on,
                defensibility through obscurity is not a good long-term
                strategy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, many of the companies I admire don't hold back on
                technical details. Even Apple—perhaps the best consumer
                marketing company in the world—includes detailed tech specs in
                their product announcements. Here is one from their launch event
                last week:
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  src="public/a19pro.png"
                  class="mix-blend-lighten"
                  alt="A19 Pro"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                Apple obviously patents many things and doesn't publicly reveal
                IP around deep technological breakthroughs, but their
                willingness to explain how features like heart rate monitoring
                and sonic acoustics work says something. Revealing information
                about how a product works builds trust with customers and peers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, in this new age of AI-powered software development, the
                shelf life of a given product configuration is dramatically
                shorter than before. Product-market fit is now more ephemeral
                than ever. A great software builder in this era won't be defined
                by a single implementation, but by the ability to continuously
                generate and implement value-intensive ideas. Whatever the cost
                of revealing a given point-in-time configuration was before, it
                is diminishing over time.
