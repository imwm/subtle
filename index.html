              A little newsletter called
              <a
                href="https://flowstate.fm"
                class="underline hover:opacity-75"

                >flowstate.fm</a
              >
              asked us for help with their sponsorship business.
            </p>
            <p>
              They wanted to make a website where people could book weekly
              sponsorships directly. They also wanted some help with outbound
              lead generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result is
              <a
                href="https://sponsor.flowstate.fm"

              Azeem Azhar recently summarized the before/after of commoditized
              intelligence (<a href="https://archive.is/dsMyG" target="_blank"

            <blockquote>
              For most of history, hiring a dozen PhDs meant a massive budget
              and months of lead time. Today, a few keystrokes in a chatbot
              summon that brainpower in seconds.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In light of this sudden appearance of free intelligence, Azhar
              continues, there's an important question:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              The question facing individuals and organizations alike is: What
              will you do when intelligence itself is suddenly ubiquitous and
              practically free?

              The way I think about this is that the traditional company is
              being unbundled...

            <p>
              When you're working for a company, your compensation is typically
              a salary and maybe a bonus and/or stock options.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the perspective of naked self-interest, an employee in this
              position should optimize their performance for the arbiters of
              this compensation, namely the managers who run performance
              reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes there is alignment between doing great work and the
              perspectives of company managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              But often, companies develop many competing considerations and
              internal prerogatives that cloud managers' judgment when it comes
              to great work.
            </p>
            <p>
              In one person teams, however, the only priority is customer
              service. Compensation in one person teams is exactly company
              revenue, and that revenue is entirely determined by customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus in one person teams, compensation is set by customers, rather
              than managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The solo team structure offers a purer reward function for
              builders.
