              </p>
              <blockquote>
                The easiest way to think about [evals] is almost like a quiz for
                a model, a test to gauge how well it knows a certain set of
                subject material, or how good it is at responding to a certain
                set of questions. So in the same way you take a calculus class
                and then you have a calculus test that sees if you've learned
                what you're supposed to learn, you have evals that test how good
                is the model at creative writing, how good is the model at
                graduate-level science, how good is the model at competitive
                coding. So you have these set of evals that basically perform as
                benchmarks for how smart or capable the model is.

              <p>
                I first encountered the idea of "eval-driven development" via
                Eugene Yan's excellent 2023 post,
                <a
                  href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-80"
                  >Patterns for Building LLM-based Systems & Products</a
                >. He goes into detail on eval methodologies, but my takeaway
                was about the importance of incorporating evals into the product
                development process. He excerpts a Hacker News comment that
                drives the point home:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                How important evals are to the team is a major differentiator
                between folks rushing out hot garbage and those seriously
                building products in the space.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                Weil's argument for the importance of evals to PMs isn't just a
                reflection of models becoming more integral to software
                experiences; it's also a reflection of the changing nature of
                the work of product management.
              </p>

              <p>
                Increasingly, the implementation of software ideas is being
                outsourced to LLMs (via products like Cursor and Lovable). The
                main role of software creators is to envision the product and
                guide the model to build and iterate on it.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you squint, this is what a PM has always done. A good PM
                writes a product requirements doc, which explains the motivation
                and goals behind the product, metrics of success, and an outline
                of how the product will work. This is, as of now, the best way
                to initialize a project using code generators (see
                <a href="/prd-md" class="underline hover:opacity-80">prd.md</a>
                for more).
              </p>

              <p>
                So really, writing evals should be an extension of a skill PMs
                should already have: defining the product and choosing the right
                indicators of its success.
              </p>
