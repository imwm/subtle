                One of our observations at Subtle is that, enabled by LLMs,
                "individuals will increasingly outperform teams." A
                <a
                  href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5188231"

                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >new paper</a
                >
                from HBS, Wharton, and Proctor & Gamble (P&G) tested this idea
                in practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Researchers worked with 776 employees at P&G, randomly assigning
                employees to (a) work with or without AI (specifically, GPT-4)
                and (b) work alone or with a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a summary of their findings, which affirm our own
                hypothesis:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                Our findings show that
                <b>AI replicates many of the benefits of human collaboration</b
                >, acting as a "cybernetic teammate." Individuals with AI
                produce solutions at a quality level comparable to two-person
                teams, indicating that AI can indeed stand in for certain
                collaborative functions. Digging deeper, the adoption of AI also
                broadens the user's reach in areas outside their core expertise.
                Workers without deep product development experience, for
                example, can leverage AI's suggestions to bridge gaps in
                knowledge or domain understanding, effectively replicating the
                knowledge integration typically achieved through human
                collaboration. This has the potential to diminish functional
                boundaries, democratizing expertise within teams and
                organizations. Moreover,
                <b
                  >professionals reported more positive emotions and fewer
                  negative emotions when engaging with AI compared to working
                  alone</b
                >, matching the emotional benefits traditionally associated with
                human teamwork.... Overall, our findings indicate that adopting
                AI in knowledge work involves more than simply adding another
                tool. By enhancing performance, bridging functional expertise,
                and reshaping collaboration patterns, GenAI prompts a rethinking
                of how organizations structure teams and individual roles.
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The performance boost is not surprising, but it was intriguing
                that the researchers explored the emotional aspect of
                collaborating with AI. Some more specifics on that finding:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                Finally, we find that AI integration leads to enhanced positive
                emotional experiences. Figures 7 and 8 present emotional
                responses across groups, illustrating that participants using AI
                reported significantly higher levels of positive emotions
                (excitement, energy, and enthusiasm) and lower levels of
                negative emotions (anxiety and frustration).
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Specifically, working with AI gives you a
                <b><i>stronger</i></b> emotional benefit (in both positive and
                negative valence) than working with a team.

              </p>
              <p>
                While negative emotions vanished at the same rate across AI
                collaborators and human collaborators, the remaining gap was in
                positive emotions, which came from working with both AI and a
                team.
              </p>
              <p>
                They also found that people working outside their domain of
                expertise got a significant gain in performance in that area
                using AI:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                The results are particularly noteworthy for non-core-job
                employees. Without AI, non-corejob employees working alone
                performed relatively poorly. Even when working in teams,
                noncore-job employees without AI showed only modest improvements
                in performance. However, when given access to AI, non-core-job
                employees working alone achieved performance levels comparable
                to teams with at least one core-job employee. This suggests that
                AI can effectively substitute for the expertise and guidance
                typically provided by team members that are familiar with the
                task at hand. This pattern demonstrates AI's potential to
                democratize expertise within organizations, extending prior work
                on individual knowledge workers (e.g., (Brynjolfsson et al.,
                2023; Dell'Acqua et al., 2023b)). AI allows less experienced
                employees to achieve performance levels that previously required
                either direct collaboration or supervision by colleagues with
                more task-related experience.

                This is a big reason one-person companies led by generalists
                will succeed. Historically, firms assembled teams of functional
                experts led by general(ist) managers. Now, one person companies
                can be run by generalists who consult AI for on-demand expertise
                in any functional area.
