                Pricing was, unexpectedly, one of the most interesting topics I
                worked on at my last startup. Here are some things I've learned:
              </p>

              <p><b>1. Design the product around the price</b></p>
              <p>
                This comes from Madhavan Ramanujam's book
                <a
                  href="https://www.amazon.com/Monetizing-Innovation-Companies-Design-Product/dp/1119240867"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  ><i>Monetizing Innovation</i></a
                >. The idea is to do price discovery before anything else, and
                then use the price as a parameter for the scope of the product.
              </p>
              <p>From the book:</p>
              <blockquote>
                "Price is more than just a dollar figure; it is an indication of
                what the customer wants—and how much they want it. It is the
                single most critical factor in determining whether a product
                makes money, yet it is an afterthought, a last-minute
                consideration made after a product is developed. It is so much
                of an afterthought that companies frequently call us [his
                pricing consultancy] and say, 'We built a product—oops, now we
                need your help in pricing it.'... The most successful product
                innovators we know start by determining what the customer values
                and what they are willing to pay, and then they design the
                products around these inputs and have a clear monetization
                strategy that they follow through with." (pp. 8-9)
              </blockquote>

              <p><b>2. Sell to businesses</b></p>
              <p>
                Building consumer products (i.e., products sold to individuals
                generally outside their work) can be fun, but the main obstacle
                is that the average person doesn't have a lot of disposable
                income to spend on software. This is why so many consumer
                products are free and then monetize via ads. The tricky thing
                with this is that monetizing via ads typically requires scale –
                think Meta or Google – so you need your consumer product to go
                viral. That's really tough to do, like capturing lightning in a
                bottle.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, building B2B products (i.e.,
                business-to-business) can be easier because companies not only
                have larger budgets in general, but also budget already
                allocated to software subscriptions specifically. Asking a
                consumer to pay $200/mo for something is a huge ask, whereas
                many businesses wouldn't bat an eye.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a solo builder, I've considered building for this persona
                (aka my persona) but have held off because (1) they are almost
                as price sensitive as consumers, and (2) their DIY mindset
                encourages them to build rather than buy software solutions.
              </p>

              <p><b>3. Price your B2B product under the "approval bar"</b></p>
              <p>
                At my last startup, we found that most employees with a company
                card didn't need to get approval for purchases under $5k/yr.
              </p>

                  >found something similar</a
                >
                in his experience selling to enterprises:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                "Because the whole [procurement] rigamarole costs several
                hundred dollars in employee salary to approve any PO, most
                internal Purchasing Departments have a few enumerated
                exceptions. One is an upper limit on expenses a worker or
                low-level manager can approve on their own authority without
                ceremony, generally by putting them on a corporate credit card.
                This limit is customarily $500 or $1,000. The greatest hack the
                software industry came up with in the last twenty years is
                monthly billing, because it lets you sell a four-figure product
                for $499 a month, evading the internal purchasing controls which
                hamper your users from getting their work done. This is why
                substantially every SaaS business should have a plan priced
                between $250 and $499 a month, because corporate employees will
                expense it on the card. It is not their money so it doesn't
                matter whether it is $99, $250, or $4,999 a month, as all those
                figures are literally rounding error to this customer, which is
                why they don't bother controlling for purchases that small.
                Accordingly, you should price to the high end of that range."
              </blockquote>

              <p><b>What I'm doing</b></p>
              <p>
                My subscription data product is now entering a private beta. On
                the second day of building it, I had friendly price discovery
                calls with a few people who represented my target customer. From
                those conversations, I realized (1) companies that were
                strategically interested in the data I'd organized would pay for
                it, and (2) a price point of around $250/mo would be reasonable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since it's just me building it, and my costs are low (excluding
                my time, maybe $50/mo), I took that to mean that I could run a
                private beta with around a dozen customers and be off to a
                decent start. This meant that I could do things that didn't
                scale, e.g., manually running crawls until recently and offering
                to partner closely with private beta customers to build out the
                platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually, I'll probably raise this price to around $400/mo or
                $4,000/yr to stay under that $5k/yr approval bar. But we'll find
                out when we do price validation before general availability.
