                Every started out as a publication back in 2020, and has since
                focused heavily on AI products, incubating their own products
                and advising companies on how to leverage new tools.
              </p>

              <p>
                This week they published
                <a
                  href="https://every.to/p/how-we-built-a-7-figure-ai-consulting-business-in-less-than-a-yea"

                  >a post</a
                >
                about how they built a 7-figure AI consulting business in the
                past year. It's long and worth reading in full, because on the
                key issues it's in 100% alignment with Subtle. Here are the
                things they are doing well:
              </p>

              <p>
                1. The publication is, effectively, lead gen for the
                consultancy. But it's not half-assed "copy" optimized for search
                engines and partly generated by AI. It's actually really good
                writing, proven by the fact that Every is already itself a
                publication with seven figures of ARR (source for this was Dan
                on Twitter; I misplaced the tweet). The regular insightful
                coverage of AI products, how people use them, and announcement
                of their own original products attracts interest.
              </p>

              <p>
                2. They earn credibility by building their own products. It's
                one thing to be an AI commentator, going on podcasts and the
                like. It's another thing to be getting your hands dirty,
                actually shipping product and learning, seeing what products
                people actually use. As they say, "Be a practitioner, not a
                management consultant."
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                Practitioners see what frameworks miss. You learn how a tool
                works, where it breaks, how people use it, and what makes it
                stick. That firsthand experience is your best diagnostic tool.
                It helps you move faster, explain more clearly, and spot what
                matters before the spec sheet tells you.
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                3. They are smart about, for lack of a better word, exploiting
                the situation that many companies find themselves in with
                respect to AI. That is, there's a rising awareness that
                knowledge work is being disrupted by LLMs and LLM-powered
                products, but there's no playbook. Every's consulting business
                has gleaned several nuances of this problem set in their first
                year:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                We assumed the hardest part of adopting AI would be technical.
                Until now, software has been deterministic: You click X, and Y
                happens. But AI is non-deterministic. You need to manage it, not
                just use it. As a result, the real blockers to AI adoption are
                cultural.<br /><br />Imagine a marketer who has one hour to
                write a campaign brief. They can either use that hour to do it
                the way they always have—manually, with help from templates and
                a tried-and-true process. Or they can take a risk: Spend that
                hour experimenting with a tool like ChatGPT, hoping it helps but
                worrying it might not. Most choose the first option—not because
                they're uninterested in AI, but because their job is to produce
                results, not to experiment. When time is tight and expectations
                are high, reliability wins. Ironically, a prompt written and
                refined today could lay the groundwork for a faster process
                tomorrow, but in the moment, it's scary to trade certainty for
                potential.<br /><br />AI adoption doesn't happen just because a
                tool is available. It happens when teams have the space, the
                support, and the cultural permission to try something new. Play,
                believe it or not, is the greatest unlock for AI adoption.
              </blockquote>

                People are super busy and barely keeping up with their normal
                job. They're behind on work and racing to hit deadlines, prep
                for important meetings, while juggling the rest of their life.
                They do not have time to figure out how to reinvent their
                personal working style, much of which has been honed and
                habituated over years or decades. Hiring a consultancy like
                Every (or
                <a href="/services.html" class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >us</a
                >) creates the space in which to do this with guidance from
                experts (insofar as there are experts in this nascent field).
