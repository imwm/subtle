                I like [Cursor]. I use it as a product. I don't see it as a good
                business.... The thing is, people are applying network thinking
                to what's fundamentally just a technology. There's no
                lock-in.... I think the whole point of AI is the switching costs
                for all this stuff goes to zero.

                It's true that the switching cost of Cursor is close to zero. As
                an example, Claire Vo of LaunchDarkly switched from Cursor to
                Windsurf after a Cursor update caused issues with how code
                updates worked:

                  I switched from Cursor to Windsurf after the last Cursor
                  update. I was having issues with how code updates worked.
                  I&#39;m a big fan of Windsurf so far. I&#39;m also a big fan
                  of competition in this space. It&#39;s moving so fast.

              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  There are already several near-perfect substitutes for Cursor
                  (Windsurf, Github Copilot). Users can easily switch, meaning
                  Cursor's revenue retention is at risk. I would worry
                  especially about Github's offering because its parent company
                  Microsoft also controls VSCode, of which Cursor is a fork.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Because public LLMs are really the core drivers of Cursor's
                  product value, the barrier to entry for new products is not
                  high. Cursor might find itself in a red ocean competing with
                  lots more code generation tools than today.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cursor appeals to people who are already familiar with the
                  integrated development environment (IDE) paradigm. But if
                  text-to-product tools like Lovable and Bolt get good enough,
                  people will ditch their IDEs along with Cursor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  General-purpose LLM products like ChatGPT and Claude are
                  increasingly building out their own productivity tools and
                  integrations with third-party ones, which could obviate the
                  need for a separate LLM-powered code editor.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>That said, I can see the following scenario play out:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Cursor continues to be the category leader in generative code
                  editors, and it continues to spread through word of mouth
                  among professional software engineers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At $100M ARR with a price tag of $20/mo, it has about 400k
                  paying customers. There are about 27M professional software
                  engineers in the world (<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_demographics"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-80"
                    >Wikipedia</a
                  >). If Cursor continues to spread quickly, it could hit $1B
                  ARR with just ~15% market share among professional software
                  engineers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Moreover, Cursor's text-based product development could also
                  attract growth from people who have not been professional
                  software engineers, which is obviously a much larger market.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                All told, that adds up to a huge amount of room for Cursor to
                run. With a brand that's essentially the ChatGPT for software
                engineering, I would bet Cursor continues to grow fast. The
                question is when it hits a wall â€“ I don't think that'll happen
                for at least another couple years.
