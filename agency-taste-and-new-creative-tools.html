                "Agency" and "taste" are buzzwords these days, but their
                popularity hints at how the creative process is changing across
                many domains.
              </p>
              <p>Starting with definitions:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Agency</strong> is the degree to which someone thinks
                  for themselves and makes decisions independent from the social
                  and intellectual consensus around them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Taste</strong> is the degree to which someone
                  appreciates the quality and quantity of details that make up
                  excellent work.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Agency and taste matter for creative work because without them,
                you get what's now popularly known as slop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sci-fi writer Ted Chiang recently explained why this is. In an
                essay in the
                <a
                  href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >New Yorker</a
                >, he noted that when AI models are prompted to write a story or
                generate an image, they reflect average choices, not brilliant
                ones. This is why he
                <a
                  href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >elsewhere</a
                >characterized ChatGPT's responses as "blurry JPEGs of the web."
              </p>
              <p>
                Art, Chiang writes, is the sum of innumerable decisions made
                during the creative process. It might look something like this:
              </p>
              <img
                class="w-full -mx-4 -mt-4"
                src="public/creative-process-model.png"
              />
              <p>
                These decision points amount to moments of expression of the
                creator's agency and taste. High-agency creators with good taste
                make unique, surprising, and effective choices, yielding great
                final products.
              </p>
              <p>
                But by outsourcing these decisions to AI models, Chiang argues,
                one produces slop because such models auto-apply the default or
                median decision across the board, a low-agency, low-taste move.
              </p>
              <p>
                While AI tools are certainly helping many people create slop, I
                would argue that the best creative tools will enhance creative
                expression.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a
                <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdP2Bmieg&ab_channel=ColinMcDonnell"

                  >classic talk</a
                >, Bret Victor noted that creators need direct relationships
                with the media they create. He distinguished between
                "engineering" and "authorship":
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Engineering</strong> is the act of manipulating an
                  indirect representation of the final product, usually code or
                  schematics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Authorship</strong> is the act of manipulating a
                  direct representation of the final product, such as composing
                  a word document.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Authorship, Victor argues, is a superior mode of creation,
                because the creator can make decisions while referencing a
                high-resolution representation of the consumer's experience.
                This creator has a lot of empathy for what the end user will
                ultimately think and feel about the work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The real promise of new creative tools, then, is not just to
                save time for creators. The promise is to give more creators
                high-fidelity representations of the end work throughout the
                creative process, from idea to distribution. This will allow
                creators to better express agency and taste in the process, and
                hopefully create even better art.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, this may explain why new AI tools have excelled in
                certain domains but not in others. AI writing tools, for
                example, have not exploded in popularity, as Lex founder Nathan
                Baschez
                <a
                  href="https://lex.page/read/019e6e2a-6ae9-481e-a0ad-3f9f68b88e06"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  target="_blank"
                  >recently noted</a
                >. However, AI coding tools (Cursor, Lovable), AI video tools
                (Runway, Sora), and AI music tools (Suno) have taken off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Word processors already offer a reasonably high-fidelity
                representation of end user experiences, as Victor noted. Compare
                that to coding â€“ that's why products like Cursor and Lovable
                feel like magic.
