                Revenue per employee is now the most important success metric,
                followed by revenue retention.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 2010s, startups often cited headcount growth as a success
                metric. I admit I played along. Back then, when I told people
                the startup I worked at had grown past 100 employees, they
                seemed impressed.
              </p>
              <p>
                But headcount never really resonated with me as a measure of a
                company's success. Many startups hired and hired, fueled by
                seemingly endless venture capital, until they blew up. This
                practice accelerated until the post-2021 comedown, which ushered
                in an era of software company layoffs (<a

              </p>
              <p>
                The new metric is revenue per employee. Public companies are
                increasingly facing investor pressure to reduce headcount while
                growing revenue. Lucrative 10-hour-a-week jobs at companies like
                Google are

                are capable of generating more revenue than ever. Because I'm a
                one-person company, my revenue per employee denominator is
                minimized; the challenge is growing the numerator.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few implications to this shift in emphasis toward
                revenue per employee:

                  <strong>Seat-based pricing models are under threat.</strong>
                  As headcounts shrink, employee accounts churn, reducing
                  revenue for seat-based products. As pricing guru Madhavan

                  higher-attribution, higher-autonomy model, where software is
                  priced by outcome (top right of this chart):

                  Big companies move slowly, and AI tools help small teams punch
                  well above their weight. But this window is closing, as big
                  companies shrink, adopt AI tools themselves, and reorganize
                  around the new mode of software development.
