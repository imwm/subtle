                The main lesson from this, actually, was to try to identify the
                languages, frameworks, and services you'll need to use up front
                when vibe coding.
              </p>

                  We ran into problems when we told Cursor, mid-project, that we
                  wanted to use Tailwind, that we wanted to deploy via Vercel,
                  that we wanted to switch from TypeScript to JavaScript.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These were all pretty painful, debug-time-consuming
                  transitions, which could have been avoided by specifying these
                  technologies up front.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I think code gen tools can do a better job of recommending
                  best practices up front before initializing the codebase. They
                  seem to pretend to be naive about modern best practices and
                  tacitly pin it on the user if they don't specify them.
                  Ethically defensible but practically annoying.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Anyhow, here's how we vibe-coded

                  I chatted with ChatGPT about this concept (thread
                  <a
                    href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67d5503e-73f0-800f-a89d-2fb7c62c55cc"
                    target="_blank"
                    class="underline hover:opacity-80"
                    >here</a
                  >). ChatGPT validated the concept and then gave some
                  instructions as how to to start implementing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I asked ChatGPT to format the project proposal into a prompt
                  for Cursor's agent to take and implement, which it did well
                  enough...
                </li>
                <li>
                  But the main thing that was missing was specification of the
                  technologies to use. This was the main lesson. You gotta
                  specify these up front.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What ChatGPT did help with was techniques to optimize text
                  extraction for LLMs, which currently includes a summary, key
                  facts, and the main content.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                I initialized it, pivoted the design to be a Google-like
                centered input box, dark mode only.
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Added the Karpathy tweet below the input field explaining the
                  value prop. I kind of like that technique of having someone
                  else established explain your product's value prop for you.
                  Social proof.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Originally, I added a getwalist.com email signup below to
                  gauge interest in an API for generating these kinds of
                  LLM-optimized strings programmatically. But then the lack of
                  customization got to me and so I just created a Supabase table
                  and had Cursor create a style-matching email signup field that
                  writes to it. Easy enough.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sidenote: this is why indie hackers are probably not a good
                  target customer. They have low willingness to pay, and they
                  can build their own solution (or at least they think they
                  can).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                I deployed, and it basically works. The optimizations I did
                afterwards were around formatting the text output, getting the
                Vercel functions to work the same way local functions did, and
                small usability enhancements.
              </p>

              <p>Next up is:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Store each URL string in Supabase to (a) cache it and (b)
                  create a kind of network effect around the use of this
                  service.
                </li>
                <li>Handle file -> optimized txt conversion.</li>
                <li>
                  Introduce an API for programmatically generating these kinds
                  of strings.
                </li>
              </ul>
