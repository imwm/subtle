                that "management skills will actually become more important in
                the AI era," specifically:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                1. Giving specific instructions<br />
                2. Setting clear expectations<br />
                3. Giving examples of what "good" looks like<br />
                4. Editing and evaluating work
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                This is true. However, this articulation occludes the managerial
                skills that are important when managing people but unimportant
                or even counterproductive when managing agents. The skills that
                don't matter when managing agents are:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>EQ</li>
                <li>Charisma</li>
                <li>Managing up</li>
                <li>Stakeholder diplomacy</li>
                <li>Cross-functional coordination</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Another one close to home is "executive presence." That's one
                I've personally struggled with in more than one role. Let's
                consider this one for a moment.
              </p>

              <p>
                To steelman the importance of executive presence, it would be
                that employees work better when they have confidence and even
                admiration for company leaders. Executives who present
                executively inspire confidence; those that don't, don't.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, I personally think there are some remarkable exceptions to
                this in recent decades: Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg, Jensen
                Huang, Dylan Field, and Elon before he went crazy.
              </p>

              <p>
                I never got a great definition of executive presence. You know
                it when you see it, I guess. I think executive presence is
                really about signaling similarity to other executives who have
                been successful before. In other words, executive presence is
                conveying resemblance to familiar successful people. I think
                that might not be a good formula for running a business.
              </p>

              <p>
                The book <i>Good to Great</i>, one of those renowned business
                books that are in every airport bookstore, surprisingly affirms
                this. That book studied public companies whose share price
                growth significantly exceeded the overall market growth. The
                authors found that the leaders of such companies were internal
                hires who had been with the company for a long time and had an
                understated demeanor. It turns out the CEOs who drove the most
                alpha were precisely the ones who lacked the kind of telegenic
                charisma one might associate with executive presence.
              </p>

              <p>
                In any case, managing agents will not be like managing people.
                Emotional intelligence and the like are important in life, to be
                sure, but increasingly they will not be important at work.
