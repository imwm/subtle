                Cursor’s Composer-1 model is my favorite model release of the
                year. It’s dramatically changed my development workflow—and it
                changed my mind about specialized models.
              </p>
              <p>
                The benchmarks that Composer-1
                <a
                  href="https://cursor.com/blog/composer"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >published upon release</a
                >
                focused on intelligence and speed:
              </p>
              <img
                src="./public/cursor-composer-benchmarks.png"
                class="mb-4 mix-blend-lighten"
                alt="Composer-1 benchmarks"
              />
              <p>
                In other words, Composer-1’s output is roughly as good as the
                frontier models (say, GPT-5 or Claude Sonnet 4.5), but it
                generates that output significantly faster.
              </p>
              <p>
                After switching from GPT-5 to Composer-1 in Cursor, I
                immediately noticed a marked speed improvement. Composer-1 felt
                about 4x faster than GPT-5. Previously, I’d expect to wait
                around 30 seconds for GPT-5 to complete significant changes to a
                repository, whereas Composer-1 rarely took more than 7 or 8
                seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is obviously a better user experience, but I noticed other
                effects of using a dramatically faster coding agent:
              </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >I’m more willing to make the marginal change to a
                    codebase.</strong
                  >
                  Since the time cost of any given change is lower, I’m likelier
                  to make more changes. This means sending the extra prompt to
                  give a feature a final_final_v4_final round of polish.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >I’m more likely to stay in flow while building a
                    feature.</strong
                  >
                  Previously, I might check email or do something else while
                  waiting for the Cursor agent—causing a context switch and
                  losing momentum. Now, there’s almost no time to do anything
                  else, and it’s fascinating to watch the model work blazingly
                  fast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >The context window in the agent chat tends to fill up more
                    quickly.</strong
                  >
                  I’m making more changes over a longer, focused session with
                  the agent (with a smaller context window). Composer-1’s
                  context window is 200k tokens, which isn’t bad, but GPT-5’s
                  was 400k tokens and other models offer 1M token windows. This
                  sometimes forces me to restart a chat deep into a
                  conversation, requiring the agent to get back up to speed on
                  the state of the codebase.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Composer-1 appears to be a hit with Cursor users, as it’s now
                the fastest-growing model on the platform (<a

              <p>
                The success of Composer-1 changed my mind about startups
                developing their own specialized models.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had heard investors and founders predict that startups would
                begin building specialized models and use them instead of the
                general-purpose LLMs from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wasn’t so sure about this, because (a) training an effective
                model that can rival the performance of a frontier model
                typically requires a huge amount of upfront capital expenditure;
                (b) that capital outlay isn’t a one-time expense, since frontier
                models keep getting significantly better; (c) frontier models
                are just an API call away, so startups can focus on product
                differentiation and growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, there are several reasons a startup might train its own
                specialized model:
              </p>
              <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Margins.</strong> Frontier models are not cheap at
                  scale. Many popular AI startups are deeply unprofitable due to
                  model provider costs. If an AI application startup can run its
                  own in-house models, it will significantly improve operating
                  margins.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Performance.</strong> Frontier models are trained to
                  be good at as many things as possible—a jack of all trades,
                  master of none. Composer-1 shows that specialized models can
                  outperform frontier models in specific application
                  environments.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                In
                <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md8D8eNj5JM"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >his recent talk at Anyscale</a
                >, Sasha Rush detailed how Cursor trained Composer-1 “through
                the production Cursor product.” Some slides that illustrate
                this:
              </p>
              <img
                src="./public/training-with-cursor.png"
                class="mb-4 invert mix-blend-lighten"
                alt="Composer-1 training with Cursor"
              />
              <img
                src="./public/cursor-agent-rl.png"
                class="mb-4 invert mix-blend-lighten"
                alt="Cursor agent RL training"
              />
              <p>
                An implication of this approach—application-specific model
                training—is that the in-house model is a "power user" of the
                application's tools, making it more effective than frontier
                models:
              </p>
              <img
                src="./public/cursor-sem-search.png"
                class="mb-4 invert mix-blend-lighten"
                alt="Composer-1 semantic search"
              />
              <p>
                The caveat to my new enthusiasm for specialized models is that
                they’re still expensive as hell. Cursor had raised almost a
                billion dollars before releasing Composer-1, and
                <a
                  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/13/cursor-ai-startup-funding-round-valuation.html"
                  target="_blank"
                  class="underline hover:opacity-75"
                  >they just raised $2.3B more</a
                >. I don’t know how much they spent training Composer-1, but I
                bet Composer-2 will cost even more.
              </p>
              <p>
                If more well-capitalized startups follow Cursor’s lead and
                deploy their own specialized models, I’ll be curious to see how
                that affects the API businesses of Anthropic and OpenAI.
              </p>
              <p>So yeah, Composer-1 is my model of the year.</p>
